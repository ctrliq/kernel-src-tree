Commit 9604eea5bd3a ("scsi: st: Add third party poweron reset handling") in
v6.6 added new code to handle the Power On/Reset Unit Attention (POR UA)
sense data. This was in addition to the existing method. When this Unit
Attention is received, the driver blocks attempts to read, write and some
other operations because the reset may have rewinded the tape. Because of
the added code, also the initial POR UA resulted in blocking operations,
including those that are used to set the driver options after the device is
recognized. Also, reading and writing are refused, whereas they succeeded
before this commit.

Add code to not set pos_unknown to block operations if the POR UA is
received from the first test_ready() call after the st device has been
created. This restores the behavior before v6.6.
