Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-528.el8/1e2cd308.failed

Especially now that GCC is developing the -ftrivial-auto-var-init
option[1], it's helpful to have a stand-alone userspace test for stack
variable initialization. Relicense to GPLv2+ (I am the only author),
provide stand-alone kernel macro stubs, and update comments for clarity.
