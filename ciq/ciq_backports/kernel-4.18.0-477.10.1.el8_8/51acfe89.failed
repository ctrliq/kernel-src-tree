To support TDX attestation, the TDX guest driver exposes an IOCTL
interface to allow userspace to get the TDREPORT0 (a.k.a. TDREPORT
subtype 0) from the TDX module via TDG.MR.TDREPORT TDCALL.

In order to get the TDREPORT0 in the TDX guest driver, instead of using
a low level function like __tdx_module_call(), add a
tdx_mcall_get_report0() wrapper function to handle it.

This is a preparatory patch for adding attestation support.
