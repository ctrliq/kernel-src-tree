Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-477.10.1.el8_8/28330dcc.failed

After struct acpi_pld_info *pld is used to fill in physical location
values, it should be freed to prevent memleak.
