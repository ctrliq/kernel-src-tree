Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-477.10.1.el8_8/1c4a59b9.failed

mlx5 doesn't allow to configure any AEAD ICV length other than 128,
so remove the logic that configures other unsupported values.
