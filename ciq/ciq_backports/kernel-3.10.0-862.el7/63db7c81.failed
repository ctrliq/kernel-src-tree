We've had user reports of unmount hangs in xfs_wait_buftarg() that
analysis shows is due to btp->bt_io_count == -1. bt_io_count
represents the count of in-flight asynchronous buffers and thus
should always be >= 0. xfs_wait_buftarg() waits for this value to
stabilize to zero in order to ensure that all untracked (with
respect to the lru) buffers have completed I/O processing before
unmount proceeds to tear down in-core data structures.

The value of -1 implies an I/O accounting decrement race. Indeed,
the fact that xfs_buf_ioacct_dec() is called from xfs_buf_rele()
(where the buffer lock is no longer held) means that bp->b_flags can
be updated from an unsafe context. While a user-level reproducer is
currently not available, some intrusive hacks to run racing buffer
lookups/ioacct/releases from multiple threads was used to
successfully manufacture this problem.

Existing callers do not expect to acquire the buffer lock from
xfs_buf_rele(). Therefore, we can not safely update ->b_flags from
this context. It turns out that we already have separate buffer
state bits and associated serialization for dealing with buffer LRU
state in the form of ->b_state and ->b_lock. Therefore, replace the
_XBF_IN_FLIGHT flag with a ->b_state variant, update the I/O
accounting wrappers appropriately and make sure they are used with
the correct locking. This ensures that buffer in-flight state can be
modified at buffer release time without racing with modifications
from a buffer lock holder.
