commit 8c42694150c27ea68a8d46996d943918c769d1d0
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-504.el8/8c426941.failed

The uvc driver relies on the camera firmware to keep the control states
and therefore is not capable of changing an inactive control.

Allow returning -EACCES in those cases.
