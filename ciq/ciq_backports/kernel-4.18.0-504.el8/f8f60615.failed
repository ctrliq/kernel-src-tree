Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-504.el8/f8f60615.failed

I was too naive in just including <asm-generic/io.h> into
hexagon: one has to specify defines for every call that uses
a (static) inline or this will not work.

Fix it up by providing proper defines for all shorthands that
hexagon provides.

Compile-tested with hexagon LLVM which is the only working cross
compiler for hexagon ATM after commenting out the
-fno-inline-functions-called-once switch which isn't working
with LLVM.
