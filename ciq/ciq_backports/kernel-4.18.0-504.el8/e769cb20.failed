Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Loading this driver in guests results in unchecked MSR access error for
MSR 0x620.

There is no use of reading and modifying package/die scope uncore MSRs
in guests. So check for CPU feature X86_FEATURE_HYPERVISOR to prevent
loading of this driver in guests.
