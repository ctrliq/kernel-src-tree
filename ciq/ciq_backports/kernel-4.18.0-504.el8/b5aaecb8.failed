Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-504.el8/b5aaecb8.failed

Convert the bus_sort_breadthfirst() function to use bus_to_subsys() and
not use the back-pointer to the private structure.

This also allows us to get rid of bus_get_device_klist() which was only
being used by this one internal function.
