Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-504.el8/504450d0.failed

The bus notifier values are not documented all that well, so clean this
up and make a real enumerated type for them and document them much
better.  When doing this, remove the hex values and just rely on the
enumerated type instead as that is all that is needed.
