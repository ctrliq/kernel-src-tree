 + * Vineetg: March 2009 (Supporting 2 levels of Interrupts)
 + *  Stack switching code can no longer reliably rely on the fact that
 + *  if we are NOT in user mode, stack is switched to kernel mode.
 + *  e.g. L2 IRQ interrupted a L1 ISR which had not yet completed
 + *  it's prologue including stack switching from user mode
 + *
 + * Vineetg: Aug 28th 2008: Bug #94984
 + *  -Zero Overhead Loop Context shd be cleared when entering IRQ/EXcp/Trap
 + *   Normally CPU does this automatically, however when doing FAKE rtie,
 + *   we also need to explicitly do this. The problem in macros
 + *   FAKE_RET_FROM_EXCPN and FAKE_RET_FROM_EXCPN_LOCK_IRQ was that this bit
 + *   was being "CLEARED" rather then "SET". Actually "SET" clears ZOL context
 + *
 + * Vineetg: May 5th 2008
 + *  -Modified CALLEE_REG save/restore macros to handle the fact that
 + *      r25 contains the kernel current task ptr
 + *  - Defined Stack Switching Macro to be reused in all intr/excp hdlrs
 + *  - Shaved off 11 instructions from RESTORE_ALL_INT1 by using the
 + *      address Write back load ld.ab instead of seperate ld/add instn

 + * vineetg: May 2011
 + *  -Userspace unaligned access emulation
 + *
 + * vineetg: Feb 2011 (ptrace low level code fixes)
 + *  -traced syscall return code (r0) was not saved into pt_regs for restoring
 + *   into user reg-file when traded task rets to user space.
 + *  -syscalls needing arch-wrappers (mainly for passing sp as pt_regs)
 + *   were not invoking post-syscall trace hook (jumping directly into
 + *   ret_from_system_call)
 + *
 + * vineetg: Nov 2010:
 + *  -Vector table jumps (@8 bytes) converted into branches (@4 bytes)
 + *  -To maintain the slot size of 8 bytes/vector, added nop, which is
 + *   not executed at runtime.
 + *
 + * vineetg: Nov 2009 (Everything needed for TIF_RESTORE_SIGMASK)
 + *  -do_signal()invoked upon TIF_RESTORE_SIGMASK as well
 + *  -Wrappers for sys_{,rt_}sigsuspend() nolonger needed as they don't
 + *   need ptregs anymore
 + *
 + * Vineetg: Oct 2009
 + *  -In a rare scenario, Process gets a Priv-V exception and gets scheduled
 + *   out. Since we don't do FAKE RTIE for Priv-V, CPU excpetion state remains
 + *   active (AE bit enabled).  This causes a double fault for a subseq valid
 + *   exception. Thus FAKE RTIE needed in low level Priv-Violation handler.
 + *   Instr Error could also cause similar scenario, so same there as well.

 + *
 + * Vineetg: May 16th, 2008
 + *  - r25 now contains the Current Task when in kernel
 + *
 + * Vineetg: Dec 22, 2007
 + *    Minor Surgery of Low Level ISR to make it SMP safe
 + *    - MMU_SCRATCH0 Reg used for freeing up r9 in Level 1 ISR
 + *    - _current_task is made an array of NR_CPUS
 + *    - Access of _current_task wrapped inside a macro so that if hardware
 + *       team agrees for a dedicated reg, no other code is touched
