Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/fbb76d57.failed

The livepatch selftest functions.sh library uses "$*" and an
intermediate variable to extract and then pass arguments from function
to function call.  The effect of this combination is that the argument
list is flattened into a single argument.  Sometimes this is benign, but
in cases like __load_mod(), the modprobe invocation will interpret all
the module parameters as a single parameter.

Drop the intermediate variable and use the "$@" special parameter as
described in the bash manual.
