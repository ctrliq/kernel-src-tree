Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/f2286ab9.failed

- Add a SPDX header;
- Adjust document and section titles;
- Fix list markups;
- Some whitespace fixes and new line breaks;
- Mark literal blocks as such;
- Add it to RCU/index.rst.
