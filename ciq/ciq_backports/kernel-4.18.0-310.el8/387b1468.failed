commit 387b14684f94483cbbb72843db406ec9a8d0d6d2
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/387b1468.failed

Convert the locking documents to ReST and add them to the
kernel development book where it belongs.

Most of the stuff here is just to make Sphinx to properly
parse the text file, as they're already in good shape,
not requiring massive changes in order to be parsed.

The conversion is actually:
  - add blank lines and identation in order to identify paragraphs;
  - fix tables markups;
  - add some lists markups;
  - mark literal blocks;
  - adjust title markups.

At its new index.rst, let's add a :orphan: while this is not linked to
the main index.rst file, in order to avoid build warnings.

+Lock Statistics
+===============
+
+What
+====
+
+As the name suggests, it provides statistics on locks.
+
+
+Why
+===
+
+Because things like lock contention can severely impact performance.
+
+How
+===
+
+Lockdep already has hooks in the lock functions and maps lock instances to
+lock classes. We build on that (see Documentation/locking/lockdep-design.rst).
+The graph below shows the relation between the lock functions and the various
+hooks therein::
+
+        __acquire
+            |
+           lock _____
+            |        \
+            |    __contended
+            |         |
+            |       <wait>
+            | _______/
+            |/
+            |
+       __acquired
+            |
+            .
+          <hold>
+            .
+            |
+       __release
+            |
+         unlock
+
+  lock, unlock	- the regular lock functions
+  __*		- the hooks
+  <> 		- states
+
+With these hooks we provide the following statistics:
+
+ con-bounces
+	- number of lock contention that involved x-cpu data
+ contentions
+	- number of lock acquisitions that had to wait
+ wait time
+     min
+	- shortest (non-0) time we ever had to wait for a lock
+     max
+	- longest time we ever had to wait for a lock
+     total
+	- total time we spend waiting on this lock
+     avg
+	- average time spent waiting on this lock
+ acq-bounces
+	- number of lock acquisitions that involved x-cpu data
+ acquisitions
+	- number of times we took the lock
+ hold time
+     min
+	- shortest (non-0) time we ever held the lock
+     max
+	- longest time we ever held the lock
+     total
+	- total time this lock was held
+     avg
+	- average time this lock was held
+
+These numbers are gathered per lock class, per read/write state (when
+applicable).
+
+It also tracks 4 contention points per class. A contention point is a call site
+that had to wait on lock acquisition.
+
+Configuration
+-------------
+
+Lock statistics are enabled via CONFIG_LOCK_STAT.

-LOCK STATISTICS
-
-- WHAT
-
-As the name suggests, it provides statistics on locks.
-
-- WHY
-
-Because things like lock contention can severely impact performance.
-
-- HOW
-
-Lockdep already has hooks in the lock functions and maps lock instances to
-lock classes. We build on that (see Documentation/locking/lockdep-design.txt).
-The graph below shows the relation between the lock functions and the various
-hooks therein.
-
-        __acquire
-            |
-           lock _____
-            |        \
-            |    __contended
-            |         |
-            |       <wait>
-            | _______/
-            |/
-            |
-       __acquired
-            |
-            .
-          <hold>
-            .
-            |
-       __release
-            |
-         unlock
-
-lock, unlock	- the regular lock functions
-__*		- the hooks
-<> 		- states
-
-With these hooks we provide the following statistics:
-
- con-bounces       - number of lock contention that involved x-cpu data
- contentions       - number of lock acquisitions that had to wait
- wait time min     - shortest (non-0) time we ever had to wait for a lock
-           max     - longest time we ever had to wait for a lock
-	   total   - total time we spend waiting on this lock
-	   avg     - average time spent waiting on this lock
- acq-bounces       - number of lock acquisitions that involved x-cpu data
- acquisitions      - number of times we took the lock
- hold time min     - shortest (non-0) time we ever held the lock
-	   max     - longest time we ever held the lock
-	   total   - total time this lock was held
-	   avg     - average time this lock was held
-
-These numbers are gathered per lock class, per read/write state (when
-applicable).
-
-It also tracks 4 contention points per class. A contention point is a call site
-that had to wait on lock acquisition.
-
- - CONFIGURATION
-
-Lock statistics are enabled via CONFIG_LOCK_STAT.
-
- - USAGE
-
-Enable collection of statistics:
-
-# echo 1 >/proc/sys/kernel/lock_stat
-
-Disable collection of statistics:
-
-# echo 0 >/proc/sys/kernel/lock_stat
-
-Look at the current lock statistics:
-
-( line numbers not part of actual output, done for clarity in the explanation
-  below )

-# less /proc/lock_stat

-This excerpt shows the first two lock class statistics. Line 01 shows the
-output version - each time the format changes this will be updated. Line 02-04
-show the header with column descriptions. Lines 05-18 and 20-31 show the actual
-statistics. These statistics come in two parts; the actual stats separated by a
-short separator (line 08, 13) from the contention points.
-
-Lines 09-12 show the first 4 recorded contention points (the code
-which tries to get the lock) and lines 14-17 show the first 4 recorded
-contended points (the lock holder). It is possible that the max
-con-bounces point is missing in the statistics.
-
-The first lock (05-18) is a read/write lock, and shows two lines above the
-short separator. The contention points don't match the column descriptors,
-they have two: contentions and [<IP>] symbol. The second set of contention
-points are the points we're contending with.
-
-The integer part of the time values is in us.
-
-Dealing with nested locks, subclasses may appear:
