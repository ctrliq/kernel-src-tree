offset is passed as a pointer and on certain call path is not set by the
function. If the caller does not re-initialize offset between calls, value
could be inherited between calls. Prevent this by initializing offset on each
call.

This impacts the code in amd_pmu_lbr_filter() which does:

   for(i=0; ...) {
       ret = get_branch_type_fused(..., &offset);
       if (offset)
          lbr_entries[i].from += offset;
   }
