The Architecture chapter of the KUnit documentation tried to include
copies of the kernel-doc for a couple of things, despite these already
existing in the API documentation. This lead to some warnings:

architecture:31: ./include/kunit/test.h:3: WARNING: Duplicate C declaration, also defined at dev-tools/kunit/api/test:66.
Declaration is '.. c:struct:: kunit_case'.
architecture:163: ./include/kunit/test.h:1217: WARNING: Duplicate C declaration, also defined at dev-tools/kunit/api/test:1217.
Declaration is '.. c:macro:: KUNIT_ARRAY_PARAM'.
architecture.rst:3: WARNING: Duplicate C declaration, also defined at dev-tools/kunit/api/test:66.
Declaration is '.. c:struct:: kunit_case'.
architecture.rst:1217: WARNING: Duplicate C declaration, also defined at dev-tools/kunit/api/test:1217.
Declaration is '.. c:macro:: KUNIT_ARRAY_PARAM'.

Get rid of these, and cleanup the mentions of the struct and macro in
question so that sphinx generates a link to the existing copy of the
documentation in the api/test document.
