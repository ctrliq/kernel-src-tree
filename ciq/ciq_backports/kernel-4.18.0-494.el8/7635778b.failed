Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-494.el8/7635778b.failed

The "Run Tests on qemu" section of run_wrapper.rst had a few issues left
over from the last big documentation refactor[1]:
- It referenced a non_uml.rst page, which was integrated into the other
  pages (including run_wrapper.rst).
- It skimmed over the use of --arch= and --cross_compile= in favour of
  using a custom --qemu_config. Since most users will want to use the
  former, let's give examples.

Remove the reference to the non-existant page, and add a couple of
examples to encourage the use of --arch= and --cross_compile=.

With this change, there should be no more broken references in the KUnit
documentation (i.e., the one mentioned in [2] is gone).
