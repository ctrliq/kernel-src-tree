commit 166115c08a9b0b846b783088808a27d739be6e8d
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-372.32.1.el8_6/166115c0.failed

retbleed will depend on spectre_v2, while spectre_v2_user depends on
retbleed. Break this cycle.
