Active State Power Management (ASPM) feature is enabled since kernel 5.14.
There are some AMD Volcanic Islands (VI) GFX cards, such as the WX3200 and
RX640, that do not work with ASPM-enabled Intel Alder Lake based systems.
Using these GFX cards as video/display output, Intel Alder Lake based
systems will freeze after suspend/resume.

The issue was originally reported on one system (Dell Precision 3660 with
BIOS version 0.14.81), but was later confirmed to affect at least 4
pre-production Alder Lake based systems.

Add an extra check to disable ASPM on Intel Alder Lake based systems with
the problematic AMD Volcanic Islands GFX cards.
