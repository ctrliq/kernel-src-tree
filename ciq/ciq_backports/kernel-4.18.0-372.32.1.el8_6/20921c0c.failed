Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-372.32.1.el8_6/20921c0c.failed

To fix a coverity complain, commit d5ac07dfbd2b
("qed: Initialize debug string array") removed "sw-platform"
(one of the common global parameters) from the dump as this
was used in the dump with an uninitialized string, however
it did not reduce the number of common global parameters
which caused the incorrect (unable to parse) register dump

this patch fixes it with reducing NUM_COMMON_GLOBAL_PARAMS
bye one.
