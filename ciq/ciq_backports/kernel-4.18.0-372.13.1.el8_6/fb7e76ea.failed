Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-372.13.1.el8_6/fb7e76ea.failed

Offload of ct clear action is just resetting the reg_c register.
It's done by allocating modify hdr resources which is limited.
Doing it multiple times is redundant and wasting modify hdr resources
and if resources depleted the driver will fail offloading the rule.
Ignore redundant ct clear actions after the first one.
