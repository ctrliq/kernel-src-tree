Provide support for user, nice, guest and guest_nice fields through
kcpustat_field().

Whether we account the delta to a nice or not nice field is decided on
top of the nice value snapshot taken at the time we call kcpustat_field().
If the nice value of the task has been changed since the last vtime
update, we may have inacurrate distribution of the nice VS unnice
cputime.

However this is considered as a minor issue compared to the proper fix
that would involve interrupting the target on nice updates, which is
undesired on nohz_full CPUs.
