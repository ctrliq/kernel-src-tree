Implement input pin state setting when the DPLL is running in automatic
mode. Unlike manual mode, the DPLL mode switching is not used here and
the implementation uses special priority value (15) to make the given
pin non-selectable.

When the user sets state of the pin as disconnected the driver
internally sets its priority in HW to 15 that prevents the DPLL to
choose this input pin. Conversely, if the pin status is set to
selectable, the driver sets the pin priority in HW to the original saved
value.
