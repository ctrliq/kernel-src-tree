Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-5.14.0-611.13.1.el9_7/a4f0866e.failed

Currently, the user is always asked about the Microchip Azurite
DPLL/PTP/SyncE core driver, even when I2C and SPI are disabled, and thus
the driver cannot be used at all.

Fix this by making the Kconfig symbol for the core driver invisible
(unless compile-testing), and selecting it by the bus glue sub-drivers.
Drop the modular defaults, as drivers should not default to enabled.
