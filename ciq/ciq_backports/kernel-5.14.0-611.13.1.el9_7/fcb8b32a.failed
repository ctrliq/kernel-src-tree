If the internal flash contains missing or corrupted configuration,
basic communication over the bus still functions, but the device
is not capable of normal operation (for example, using mailboxes).

This condition is indicated in the info register by the ready bit.
If this bit is cleared, the probe procedure times out while fetching
the device state.

Handle this case by checking the ready bit value in zl3073x_dev_start()
and skipping DPLL device and pin registration if it is cleared.
Do not report this condition as an error, allowing the devlink device
to be registered and enabling the user to flash the correct configuration.
