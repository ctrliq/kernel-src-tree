PCI/pwrctrl: Cancel outstanding rescan work when unregistering

jira LE-3822
cve CVE-2025-38137
Rebuild_History Non-Buildable kernel-6.12.0-55.27.1.el10_0

commit 8b926f237743f020518162c62b93cb7107a2b5eb
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-6.12.0-55.27.1.el10_0/8b926f23.failed

It's possible to trigger use-after-free here by:

  (a) forcing rescan_work_func() to take a long time and
  (b) utilizing a pwrctrl driver that may be unloaded for some reason

Cancel outstanding work to ensure it is finished before we allow our data
structures to be cleaned up.
