Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-rt-5.14.0-284.30.1.rt14.315.el9_2/400dd489.failed

Update the sapphirerapids metrics and events using the new tooling from:

  https://github.com/intel/perfmon

The metrics are unchanged but the formulas differ due to parentheses,
use of exponents and removal of redundant operations like "* 1". The
order of metrics varies as TMA metrics are first converted and then
removed if perfmon versions are found. The events are updated to 1.09,
in particular uncore, with fixes to uncore events and improved
descriptions. The formatting changes increase consistency across the
json files.
