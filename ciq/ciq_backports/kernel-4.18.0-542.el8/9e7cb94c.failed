Patch series "add KSM performance tests", v3.

Extend KSM self tests with a performance benchmark.  These tests are not
part of regular regression testing, as they are mainly intended to be used
by developers making changes to the memory management subsystem.

This patch (of 2):

Add ksm_merge_time() function to determine speed and time needed for
merging.  The total spent time is shown in seconds while speed is in
MiB/s.  User must specify the size of duplicated memory area (in MiB)
before running the test.

The test is run as follows: ./ksm_tests -P -s 100
The output:
	Total size:    100 MiB
	Total time:    0.201106786 s
	Average speed:  497.248 MiB/s
