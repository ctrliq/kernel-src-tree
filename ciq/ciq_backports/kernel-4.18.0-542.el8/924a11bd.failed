Since merged pages are copied every time they need to be modified, the
write access time is different between shared and non-shared pages.  Add
ksm_cow_time() function which evaluates latency of these COW breaks.
First, 4000 pages are allocated and the time, required to modify 1 byte in
every other page, is measured.  After this, the pages are merged into 2000
pairs and in each pair, 1 page is modified (i.e.  they are decoupled) to
detect COW breaks.  The time needed to break COW of merged pages is then
compared with performance of non-shared pages.

The test is run as follows: ./ksm_tests -C
The output:
	Total size:    15 MiB

	Not merged pages:
	Total time:     0.002185489 s
	Average speed:  3202.945 MiB/s

	Merged pages:
	Total time:     0.004386872 s
	Average speed:  1595.670 MiB/s
