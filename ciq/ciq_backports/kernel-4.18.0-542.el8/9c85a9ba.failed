Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Avoid calling mmap with requested addresses that are less than the
system's mmap_min_addr.  When run as root, mmap returns EACCES when
trying to map addresses < mmap_min_addr.  This is not one of the error
codes for the condition to retry the mmap in the test.

Rather than arbitrarily retrying on EACCES, don't attempt an mmap until
addr > vm.mmap_min_addr.

Add a munmap call after an alignment check as the mappings are retained
after the retry and can reach the vm.max_map_count sysctl.
