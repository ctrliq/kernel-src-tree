Patch series "selftests: vm: a few fixup patches".

This series contains three fixup patches for vm selftests.  They are
independent.  Please see the patches.


This patch (of 3):

Currently, ksm_tests operates "merge_across_nodes" with NUMA either
enabled or disabled.  In a system with NUMA disabled, these operations
will fail and output a misleading report given "merge_across_nodes" does
not exist in sysfs:

  ----------------------------
  running ./ksm_tests -M -p 10
  ----------------------------
  f /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/merge_across_nodes
  fopen: No such file or directory
  Cannot save default tunables
  [FAIL]
  ----------------------

So check numa_available() before those operations to skip them if NUMA is
disabled.
