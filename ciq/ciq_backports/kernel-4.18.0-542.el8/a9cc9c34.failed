commit a9cc9c3456551bf78acdd330713cf513816bbdd2
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-542.el8/a9cc9c34.failed

With a large mmap map size, we can overlap with the text area and using
MAP_FIXED results in unmapping that area.  Switch to MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE
and handle the EEXIST error.
