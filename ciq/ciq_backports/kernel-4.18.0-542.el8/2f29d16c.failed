Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-542.el8/2f29d16c.failed

Dummy variables are required in order to make these two (similar)
routines work, so in both cases, declare the variables as volatile in
order to avoid the clang compiler warning.

Furthermore, in order to ensure that each test actually does what is
intended, add an asm volatile invocation (thanks to David Hildenbrand
for the suggestion), with a clarifying comment so that it survives
future maintenance.
