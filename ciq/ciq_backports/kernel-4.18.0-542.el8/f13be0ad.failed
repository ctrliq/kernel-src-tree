Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-542.el8/f13be0ad.failed

When run under run_vmtests.sh, test scripts were failing to run with
"permission denied" due to the scripts not being executable.

It is also annoying not to be able to directly invoke run_vmtests.sh,
which is solved by giving also it the execute permission.
