The va_high_addr_switch selftest is used to test mmap across 128TB
boundary.  It divides the selftest cases into two main categories on the
basis of size.  One set is used to create mappings that are multiples of
PAGE_SIZE while the other creates mappings that are multiples of
HUGETLB_SIZE.

In order to run the hugetlb testcases the binary must be appended with
"--run-hugetlb" but the file that used to run the test only invokes the
binary, thereby completely skipping the hugetlb testcases.  Hence, the
required statement has been added.
