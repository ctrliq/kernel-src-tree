Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

This patch adds a test case to check if a PMD-alignment optimization
successfully happens.

I add support to make sure there is some room before the source mapping,
otherwise the optimization to trigger PMD-aligned move will be disabled as
the kernel will detect that a mapping before the source exists and such
optimization becomes impossible.
