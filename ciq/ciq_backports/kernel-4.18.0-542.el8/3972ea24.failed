Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-542.el8/3972ea24.failed

MADV_PAGEOUT, MADV_POPULATE_READ, MADV_COLLAPSE are conditionally
defined as necessary. However, that was being done in .c files, and a
new build failure came up that would have been automatically avoided had
these been in a common header file.

So consolidate and move them all to vm_util.h, which fixes the build
failure.

An alternative approach from Muhammad Usama Anjum was: rely on "make
headers" being required, and include asm-generic/mman-common.h. This
works in the sense that it builds, but it still generates warnings about
duplicate MADV_* symbols, and the goal here is to get a fully clean (no
warnings) build here.
