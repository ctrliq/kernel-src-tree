Since commit caeb178c60f4 ("sched/fair: Make update_sd_pick_busiest() ...")
sd_pick_busiest returns a group that can be neither imbalanced nor overloaded
but is only more loaded than others. This change has been introduced to ensure
a better load balance in system that are not overloaded but as a side effect,
it can also generate useless active migration between groups.

Let take the example of 3 tasks on a quad cores system. We will always have an
idle core so the load balance will find a busiest group (core) whenever an ILB
is triggered and it will force an active migration (once above
nr_balance_failed threshold) so the idle core becomes busy but another core
will become idle. With the next ILB, the freshly idle core will try to pull the
task of a busy CPU.
The number of spurious active migration is not so huge in quad core system
because the ILB is not triggered so much. But it becomes significant as soon as
you have more than one sched_domain level like on a dual cluster of quad cores
where the ILB is triggered every tick when you have more than 1 busy_cpu

We need to ensure that the migration generate a real improveùent and will not
only move the avg_load imbalance on another CPU.

Before caeb178c60f4f93f1b45c0bc056b5cf6d217b67f, the filtering of such use
case was ensured by the following test in f_b_g:

  if ((local->idle_cpus < busiest->idle_cpus) &&
		    busiest->sum_nr_running  <= busiest->group_weight)

This patch modified the condition to take into account situation where busiest
group is not overloaded: If the diff between the number of idle cpus in 2
groups is less than or equal to 1 and the busiest group is not overloaded,
moving a task will not improve the load balance but just move it.

A test with sysbench on a dual clusters of quad cores gives the following
results:

  command: sysbench --test=cpu --num-threads=5 --max-time=5 run

The HZ is 200 which means that 1000 ticks has fired during the test.

With Mainline, perf gives the following figures:
