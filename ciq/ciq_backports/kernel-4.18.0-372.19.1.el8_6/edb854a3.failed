We currently use ->cmd_per_lun as initial queue depth for setting up the
budget_map. Martin Wilck reported that it is common for the queue_depth to
be subsequently updated in slave_configure() based on detected hardware
characteristics.

As a result, for some drivers, the static host template settings for
cmd_per_lun and can_queue won't actually get used in practice. And if the
default values are used to allocate the budget_map, memory may be consumed
unnecessarily.

Fix the issue by reallocating the budget_map after ->slave_configure()
returns. At that time the device queue_depth should accurately reflect what
the hardware needs.
