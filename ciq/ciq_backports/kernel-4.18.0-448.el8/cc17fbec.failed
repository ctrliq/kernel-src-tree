Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/cc17fbec.failed

If probing fails, the AMD SPI driver pretends success to the driver core
by returning 0.  Return the errno instead.
