Calling kmem_cache_destroy() while the cache still has objects allocated
is a kernel bug, and will usually result in the entire cache being
leaked.  While the message in kmem_cache_destroy() resembles a warning,
it is currently not implemented using a real WARN().

This is problematic for infrastructure testing the kernel, all of which
rely on the specific format of WARN()s to pick up on bugs.

Some 13 years ago this used to be a simple WARN_ON() in slub, but commit
d629d8195793 ("slub: improve kmem_cache_destroy() error message")
changed it into an open-coded warning to avoid confusion with a bug in
slub itself.

Instead, turn the open-coded warning into a real WARN() with the message
preserved, so that test systems can actually identify these issues, and
we get all the other benefits of using a normal WARN().  The warning
message is extended with "when called from <caller-ip>" to make it even
clearer where the fault lies.

For most configurations this is only a cosmetic change, however, note
that WARN() here will now also respect panic_on_warn.
