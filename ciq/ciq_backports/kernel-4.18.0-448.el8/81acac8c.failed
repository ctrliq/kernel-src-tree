Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/81acac8c.failed

The rx_buffer is cleared before sending an IPC to make sure that when the
/sys/kernel/debug/sof/ipc_msg_inject file is read we will have correct
information in the buffer (no random or stale data).

But if the user reads the file before sending any message the buffer might
contain garbage which should not be interpreted.

To prevent this, clear the rx_buffer on allocation.
