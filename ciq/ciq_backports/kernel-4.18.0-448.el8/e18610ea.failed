Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/e18610ea.failed

SND_SOC_SOF_HDA_PROBES must be tristate because the code it builds
depends on code that is tristate.

If SND_SOC_SOF_HDA_PROBES is bool it leads to the following build
inconsistency:

SND_SOC_SOF_HDA_COMMON=m
  which selects SND_SOC_SOF_HDA_PROBES
    but since this is a bool SND_SOC_SOF_HDA_PROBES=y

SND_SOC_SOF_HDA_PROBES=y
  selects SND_SOC_SOF_DEBUG_PROBES=y
    so sof-client-probes.c is built into the kernel.

sof-client-probes.c calls functions in sof-client.c, but

SND_SOC_SOF=m
  sof-client.c is built into a loadable module.
