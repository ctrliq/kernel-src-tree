Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/e414b05e.failed

DSP controls are exposed as ALSA controls, however,
some of these controls are required to be accessed by
the driver. Add apis which allow read/write of these
controls. The write api will also notify the ALSA control
on value change.
