This is required to support CS35L41 calibration.

By default, speaker protection firmware will be loaded, if
available. However, different firmware is required to run
the calibration sequence, so it is necessary to add support
to be able to unload, switch and reload firmware.

This patch adds 2 ALSA Controls for each amp:
"DSP1 Firmware Load"
"DSP1 Firmware Type"

"DSP1 Firmware Load" can be used to unload and
load the firmware.
"DSP1 Firmware Type"  can be used to switch the
target firmware to be loaded by "DSP1 Firmware Load"

Since loading firmware can add new ALSA controls, it is
necessary to ensure the firmware loading is run asynchronously
from the ALSA control itself to prevent deadlocks.

Note: When switching between firmwares, an ALSA control is
only added if it has not previously existed. If it had existed
previously, it will be re-enabled instead.
