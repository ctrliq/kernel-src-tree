When commit 72f2ecb7ece7 ("ACPI: bus: Set CPPC _OSC bits for all
and when CPPC_LIB is supported") was introduced, we found collateral
damage that a number of AMD systems that supported CPPC but
didn't advertise support in _OSC stopped having a functional
amd-pstate driver. The _OSC was only enforced on Intel systems at that
time.

This was fixed for the MSR based designs by commit 8b356e536e69f
("ACPI: CPPC: Don't require _OSC if X86_FEATURE_CPPC is supported")
but some shared memory based designs also support CPPC but haven't
advertised support in the _OSC.  Add support for those designs as well by
hardcoding the list of systems.

Fixes: 72f2ecb7ece7 ("ACPI: bus: Set CPPC _OSC bits for all and when CPPC_LIB is supported")
Fixes: 8b356e536e69f ("ACPI: CPPC: Don't require _OSC if X86_FEATURE_CPPC is supported")
