Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

The current check only worked for AP mode, but we can do
radar detection in mesh as well (for example). We could
try to check this using wdev_chandef(), but we also don't
really care since the chandef is passed in and we have no
need to use it anymore (since we added the argument in
commit d2859df5e7f0 ("cfg80211/mac80211: DFS setup chandef
for cac event")).
