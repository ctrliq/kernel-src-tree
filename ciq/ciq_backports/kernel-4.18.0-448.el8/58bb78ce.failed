Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/58bb78ce.failed

Address a few problems with the initial test script version:

* On systems with ip6tables but no ip6tables-legacy, testing for
  ip6tables was disabled by accident.
* Firewall setup phase did not respect possibly unavailable tools.
* Consistently call nft via '$nft'.
