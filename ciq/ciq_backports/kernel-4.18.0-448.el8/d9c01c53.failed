Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/d9c01c53.failed

The ACPI device with CSC3551 or CLSA0100 are sound cards
with multiple instances of CS35L41 connected by I2C or SPI
to the main CPU.

We add an ID to the ignore_serial_bus_ids list to enumerate
all I2C or SPI devices correctly.

The same IDs are also added into serial-multi-instantiate
so that the driver can correctly enumerate the ACPI.
