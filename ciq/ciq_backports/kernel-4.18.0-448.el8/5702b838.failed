Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/5702b838.failed

Move the size checks prior to allocating memory as these checks do not need
the data to be allocated and in case of an error we would not need to free
the allocation.

The max size must not be less than the size of
struct sof_ipc_ctrl_data + struct sof_abi_hdr as the ABI header needs to
be present under all circumstances.
The check was incorrectly used or between the two size checks.
