Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/d671fa63.failed

It is necessary to set fd to -1 when inotify_add_watch() fails in
cg_prepare_for_wait. Otherwise the fd which has been closed in
cg_prepare_for_wait may be misused in other functions such as
cg_enter_and_wait_for_frozen and cg_freeze_wait.
