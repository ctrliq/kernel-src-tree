Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/2b60c49f.failed

The AMD SPI driver uses devm_ioremap_resource() to map its registers, so
they're automatically unmapped via device_release() when the last ref on
the SPI controller is dropped.  The additional iounmap() in the ->probe()
error path is thus unnecessary.
