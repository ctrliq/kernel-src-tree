Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/bedc3572.failed

This if statement is reversed.  In fact, the condition can just be
deleted because writing zero bytes is a no-op.
