Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/bd3df9ff.failed

IPC4 uses the SET_DX message to enable/disable cores managed by the DSP.
The dx_state.core_mask indicates which core is going to change state,
the dx_state.dx_mask is to power on (1) or off (0) the core.
In the dx_mask only those bits (cores) checked which bit is set in the
core_mask, other bits (cores) ignored.
