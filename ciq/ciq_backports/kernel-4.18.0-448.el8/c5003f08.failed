If user space provides smaller buffer than the IPC4 reply then it is
possible that we corrupt user space memory since the IPC4 dfs_read function
is not using the count directly in copy_to_user() due to the nature of
an IPC4 message.

Cap the remaining counter to make sure that we are not writing too much to
the user space provided buffer.

Add a check also to make sure that the buffer is at least the size of the
IPC4 header.
