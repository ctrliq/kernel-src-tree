The mptcp socket and its subflow sockets in accept queue can't be
released after the process exit.

While the release of a mptcp socket in listening state, the
corresponding tcp socket will be released too. Meanwhile, the tcp
socket in the unaccept queue will be released too. However, only init
subflow is in the unaccept queue, and the joined subflow is not in the
unaccept queue, which makes the joined subflow won't be released, and
therefore the corresponding unaccepted mptcp socket will not be released
to.

This can be reproduced easily with following steps:

1. create 2 namespace and veth:
   $ ip netns add mptcp-client
   $ ip netns add mptcp-server
   $ sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=0
   $ ip netns exec mptcp-client sysctl -w net.mptcp.enabled=1
   $ ip netns exec mptcp-server sysctl -w net.mptcp.enabled=1
   $ ip link add red-client netns mptcp-client type veth peer red-server \
     netns mptcp-server
   $ ip -n mptcp-server address add 10.0.0.1/24 dev red-server
   $ ip -n mptcp-server address add 192.168.0.1/24 dev red-server
   $ ip -n mptcp-client address add 10.0.0.2/24 dev red-client
   $ ip -n mptcp-client address add 192.168.0.2/24 dev red-client
   $ ip -n mptcp-server link set red-server up
   $ ip -n mptcp-client link set red-client up

2. configure the endpoint and limit for client and server:
   $ ip -n mptcp-server mptcp endpoint flush
   $ ip -n mptcp-server mptcp limits set subflow 2 add_addr_accepted 2
   $ ip -n mptcp-client mptcp endpoint flush
   $ ip -n mptcp-client mptcp limits set subflow 2 add_addr_accepted 2
   $ ip -n mptcp-client mptcp endpoint add 192.168.0.2 dev red-client id \
     1 subflow

3. listen and accept on a port, such as 9999. The nc command we used
   here is modified, which makes it use mptcp protocol by default.
   $ ip netns exec mptcp-server nc -l -k -p 9999

4. open another *two* terminal and use each of them to connect to the
   server with the following command:
   $ ip netns exec mptcp-client nc 10.0.0.1 9999
   Input something after connect to trigger the connection of the second
   subflow. So that there are two established mptcp connections, with the
   second one still unaccepted.

5. exit all the nc command, and check the tcp socket in server namespace.
   And you will find that there is one tcp socket in CLOSE_WAIT state
   and can't release forever.

Fix this by closing all of the unaccepted mptcp socket in
mptcp_subflow_queue_clean() with __mptcp_close().

Now, we can ensure that all unaccepted mptcp sockets will be cleaned by
__mptcp_close() before they are released, so mptcp_sock_destruct(), which
is used to clean the unaccepted mptcp socket, is not needed anymore.

The selftests for mptcp is ran for this commit, and no new failures.
