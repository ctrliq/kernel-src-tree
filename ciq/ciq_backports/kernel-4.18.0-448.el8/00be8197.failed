Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Since commit fe99d1c06c16 ("ice: make ice_reset_all_vfs void"), the
ice_reset_all_vfs function has not returned anything. The function comment
still indicated it did. Fix this.

While here, also add a line to clarify the function resets all VFs at once
in response to hardware resets such as a PF reset.
