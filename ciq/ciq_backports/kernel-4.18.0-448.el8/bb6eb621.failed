To be able to support different firmwares and tuning
for different models, the driver needs to be able to
load a different firmware and coefficient file based
on its Subsystem ID.

The driver attempts to load the firmware in the
following order:

/lib/firmware/cirrus/cs35l41-dsp1-<fw-type>-<ssid>-dev<#>.wmfw
/lib/firmware/cirrus/cs35l41-dsp1-<fw-type>-<ssid>.wmfw
/lib/firmware/cirrus/cs35l41-dsp1-<fw-type>.wmfw
