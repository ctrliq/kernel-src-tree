Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/dea99773.failed

The code already has a post_stop callback, add a matching pre_stop
callback to the client_ops that is called before execution is stopped.
This callback provides a convenient place for the client code to
communicate with the DSP before it is stopped.
