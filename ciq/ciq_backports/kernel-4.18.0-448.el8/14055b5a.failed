The code already has a post_run callback, add a matching pre_run
callback to the client_ops that is called before execution is started.
This callback provides a convenient place for the client code to
set DSP controls or hardware that requires configuration before
the DSP core actually starts execution. Note that placing this callback
before cs_dsp_coeff_sync_controls is important to ensure that any
control values are then correctly synced out to the chip.
