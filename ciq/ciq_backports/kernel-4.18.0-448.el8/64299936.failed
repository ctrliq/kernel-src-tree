commit 642999365da3b7cd5552ec758d6e1bb6f2f465d8
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/64299936.failed

The comments are inconsistent and point to the wrong driver name.
The initially named i2c-multi-instantiate it was renamed to the
serial-multi-instantiate exactly due to support of the platforms
with multiple CS35L41 codecs.

Fix comments accordingly.

While at it, drop file names from the files.
