Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/8af6b91f.failed

When "crashkernel=X,high" is used, there may be two crash regions:
high=crashk_res and low=crashk_low_res. But now the syscall
kexec_file_load() only add crashk_res into "linux,usable-memory-range",
this may cause the second kernel to have no available dma memory.

Fix it like kexec-tools does for option -c, add both 'high' and 'low'
regions into the dtb.
