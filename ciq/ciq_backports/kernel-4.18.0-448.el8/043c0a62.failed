Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/043c0a62.failed

Move the lockdep asserts until after the ctl pointer has been checked
for NULL, to avoid potentially NULL pointer dereferences.
