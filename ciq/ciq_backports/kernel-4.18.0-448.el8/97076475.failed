Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/97076475.failed

When waking from hibernation, it is possible for the function
which sends the wake command to fail initially, but after a
retry it will succeed. There is no need to print an error if
the initial attempts fail.
