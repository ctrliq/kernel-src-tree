dt-bindings: remove 'interrupt-parent' from bindings

commit 791d3ef2e11100449837dc0b6fe884e60ca3a484
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/791d3ef2.failed

'interrupt-parent' is often documented as part of define bindings, but
it is really outside the scope of a device binding. It's never required
in a given node as it is often inherited from a parent node. Or it can
be implicit if a parent node is an 'interrupt-controller' node. So
remove it from all the binding files.
