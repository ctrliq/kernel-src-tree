Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/c91f7e94.failed

The ASoC core has now been changed to default to the non-legacy DAI
naming, as such drivers using the new scheme no longer need to specify
the non_legacy_dai_naming flag.
