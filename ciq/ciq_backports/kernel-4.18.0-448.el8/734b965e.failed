External boost enables sequences for devices with or without GPIO1 as
VSPK switch are the same if devices are put in safe mode from reset.
As a previous patch put all external boost devices into safe mode
from reset, all external boost devices can be handled in the same way
for stream open and close.

The only difference is that devices without an VSPK switch can not be
put in reset and devices with it can be put into reset if a
configuration is applied.
The function cs35l41_hda_safe_reset is created to handle the safe reset
of the chip, and as systems without VSPK switch are not supported
anymore, only the CS35L41 HDA driver should check its return.
