Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/06896454.failed

memory_block structure elements 'hw' and 'phys_callback' are not getting
used.  This was originally added with commit 3947be1969a9 ("[PATCH]
memory hotplug: sysfs and add/remove functions") but never seem to have
been used.  Just drop them now.
