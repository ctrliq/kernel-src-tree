Currently the domain bit in ipc msg for module initialization is
set to lp (low power) mode for pipeline. This is not correct since
it is for module domain type:  ll domain or dp domain which are for
scheduler in fw. If the domain bit is set to 1 fw will process the
module in dp domain or deal it with ll domain. So set domain bit
based on dp domain setting.
