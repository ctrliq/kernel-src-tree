Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/5c903f64.failed

Some firmwares contain controls intended to convey firmware state back
to the host. Whilst more infrastructure will probably be needed for
these in time, as a first step allow creation of the controls, so said
firmwares arn't completely rejected.
