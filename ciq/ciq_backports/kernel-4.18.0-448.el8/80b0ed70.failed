Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/80b0ed70.failed

Add attributes for reporting hardware timestamps for management frames
RX and TX. These attributes will be used for reporting hardware
timestamps for Timing measurement and Fine Timing Measurement action
frames, which will allow userspace applications to measure the path
delay between devices and sync clocks.

For TX, these attributes are used for reporting the frame RX time and
the ack TX time. For TX, they are used for reporting the frame TX time
and the ack RX time.

+  *	%NL80211_CMD_START_AP in %NL80211_CMD_GET_WIPHY response. If this

+  *	probably reset when the device is stopped or the firmware is reset.
+  *	When used with %NL80211_CMD_FRAME_TX_STATUS, indicates the frame TX
+  *	timestamp. When used with %NL80211_CMD_FRAME RX notification, indicates
+  *	the ack TX timestamp.
+  * @NL80211_ATTR_RX_HW_TIMESTAMP: Hardware timestamp for RX operation in
+  *	nanoseconds (u64). This is the device clock timestamp so it will
+  *	probably reset when the device is stopped or the firmware is reset.
+  *	When used with %NL80211_CMD_FRAME_TX_STATUS, indicates the ack RX
