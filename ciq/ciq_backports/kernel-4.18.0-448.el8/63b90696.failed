Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/63b90696.failed

Use the context save callback to power down the primary core which is used
by the firmware as an indication that the DSP is going to be turned off.

The IMR boot setup is done in response to the primary core power down.
