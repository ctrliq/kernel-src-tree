commit d1c73a213b462058e91654b5d1d493b3003375cd
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/d1c73a21.failed

Before suspending, walk through all the widgets to make sure all
refcounts are zero. If not, the resume will not work and random errors
will be reported. Adding this paranoia check will help identify leaks
and broken sequences.
