Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/6bcba1bd.failed

There is no reason to wait with the kmalloc to after parsing all
other actions. There could still be a failure later and before
offloading the rule. So alloc the mem when parsing.
The memory is being released on mlx5e_flow_put() which is called
also on error flow.
