Currently the ssd130x driver only sets the segment remap setting when
the device tree requests it; it however does not clear the setting if
it is not requested. This leads to the setting incorrectly persisting
if the hardware is always on and has no reset GPIO wired. This might
happen when a developer is trying to find the correct settings for an
unknown module, and cause the developer to get confused because the
settings from the device tree are not consistently applied.

Make the driver apply the segment remap setting consistently, setting
the value correctly based on the device tree setting. This also makes
this setting's behavior consistent with the other settings, which are
always applied.
