Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/7267aa6d.failed

It's not truly a ring, but the maximum length of the list of queued RX
 SKBs is analogous to an RX ring size, so use that API to configure it.
