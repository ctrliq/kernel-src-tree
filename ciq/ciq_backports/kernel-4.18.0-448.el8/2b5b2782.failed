Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/2b5b2782.failed

Instead of calling specific resource counter, let just probe each
of the type and see what it says. Return -ENOENT if no resources
found.
