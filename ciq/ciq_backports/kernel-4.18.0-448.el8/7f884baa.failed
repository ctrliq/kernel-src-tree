commit 7f884baae68adc85db55b97e3fc903a1f20bd1f9
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/7f884baa.failed

Somehow kernel-doc complains here about strong markup, but
we really don't need the [] so just remove that.

+  * @change_vif_links: Change the valid links on an interface, note that while
+  *	removing the old link information is still valid (link_conf pointer),
+  *	but may immediately disappear after the function returns. The old or
+  *	new links bitmaps may be 0 if going from/to a non-MLO situation.
+  *	The @old array contains pointers to the old bss_conf structures
+  *	that were already removed, in case they're needed.
+  *	This callback can sleep.
+  * @change_sta_links: Change the valid links of a station, similar to
+  *	@change_vif_links. This callback can sleep.
+  *	Note that a sta can also be inserted or removed with valid links,
+  *	i.e. passed to @sta_add/@sta_state with sta->valid_links not zero.
+  *	In fact, cannot change from having valid_links and not having them.
