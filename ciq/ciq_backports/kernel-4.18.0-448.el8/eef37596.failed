Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/eef37596.failed

On some laptop models, the ACPI contains the unique
Subsystem ID, and this value should be preferred
over the value from the HDA driver.
