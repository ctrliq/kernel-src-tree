Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/b737fd8c.failed

Set the swidget->private or dai->private to NULL after kfree in the error
handling in ipc_setup(). The private needs to be set NULL because if
ipc_setup() returns error, ipc_free() will be called later. ipc_free()
will judge the private is NULL or not to do the clearing.

For dai widget, dai->private is allocated and set in dai widget
ipc_setup(). So we need to check dai->private is NULL or not
in the ipc_free().
