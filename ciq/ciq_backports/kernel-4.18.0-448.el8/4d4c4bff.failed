commit 4d4c4bff4f8ed79d95e0592aed6c6144d558a236
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/4d4c4bff.failed

For devices which use HID CSC3551, correct ACPI _DSD properties are
required to be able support those systems.
Add error message to clarify this.
