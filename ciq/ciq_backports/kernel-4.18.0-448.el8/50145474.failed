Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/50145474.failed

This (and the VGA soft scrollback) turns out to have various nasty small
special cases that nobody really is willing to fight.  The soft
scrollback code was really useful a few decades ago when you typically
used the console interactively as the main way to interact with the
machine, but that just isn't the case any more.

So it's not worth dragging along.
