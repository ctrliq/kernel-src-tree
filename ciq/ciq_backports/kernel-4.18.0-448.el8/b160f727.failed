Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/b160f727.failed

To make the code clear, reformat the comment in dropreason.h to k-doc
style.

Now, the comment can pass the check of kernel-doc without warnning:

$ ./scripts/kernel-doc -v -none include/linux/dropreason.h
include/linux/dropreason.h:7: info: Scanning doc for enum skb_drop_reason
