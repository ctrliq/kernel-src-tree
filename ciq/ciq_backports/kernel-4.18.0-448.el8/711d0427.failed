Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/711d0427.failed

The existing code allocate/release instance_id in widget ipc_prepare/
ipc_unprepare callbacks and creating widget with the instance_id in
tplg widget_setup callback. In the case of multiple widgets connecting
to one widget, the ipc_unprepare will be invoked for all the widgets
in the path including the widget which is still in use.
As a result, the instance_id is released in the ipc_unprepare callback,
but the widget is still in use and the instance_id will be reused by
a new widget when we start the PCM again.
Moving the ida work from ipc_prepare/ipc_unprepare to widget_setup/free
can avoid such problem.
