commit b50a99979865555381780dc1fea10afb3a0f98fa
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/b50a9997.failed

For each case, only log the last regmap access, so it doesn't get
overwritten, and as all regmap access should show the same issues
logging the last one should be enough.
Change to dev_err to log this error.

Also, differentiate between a regmap access failure and invalid
playback action.
