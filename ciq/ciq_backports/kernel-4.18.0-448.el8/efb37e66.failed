Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

The SSD130x's command to toggle COM scan direction uses bit 3 and only
bit 3 to set the direction of the scanout. The driver has an incorrect
GENMASK(3, 2), causing the setting to be set on bit 2, rendering it
ineffective.

Fix the mask to only bit 3, so that the requested setting is applied
correctly.
