Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/d9a251a0.failed

This code is supposed to propagate errors from simple_write_to_buffer()
or return -EFAULT if "size != count".  However "size" needs to be signed
for the code to work correctly and the case where "size == 0" is not
handled correctly.

Fixes: 2f0b1b013bbc ("ASoC: SOF: debug: Add support for IPC message injection")
