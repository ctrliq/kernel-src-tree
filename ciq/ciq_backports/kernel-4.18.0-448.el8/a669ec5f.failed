Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/a669ec5f.failed

Provide a way for the client drivers to query the maximum payload size of
an IPC message.
Currently clients do not have access to this information and they can only
use the SOF_IPC_MSG_MAX_SIZE defined value.
