Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/73189c06.failed

Initial IPC4 tests used the same conventions as previous reference
closed-source firmware, but for MeteorLake the convention is the same
as previous SOF releases (sof-<platform>.ri). Only the prefix changes
to avoid confusions between IPC types.

This change has no impact on users since the firmware has not yet been
released.
