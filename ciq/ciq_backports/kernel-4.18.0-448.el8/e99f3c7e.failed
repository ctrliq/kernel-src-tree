Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/e99f3c7e.failed

The Subsystem ID is read from the HDA driver, and will
be used by the CS35L41 driver to be able to uniquely
identify the laptop, which is required to be able to
define firmware to be used by specific models.
