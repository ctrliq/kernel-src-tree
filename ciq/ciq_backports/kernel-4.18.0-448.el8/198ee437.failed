Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/198ee437.failed

Convert the debug message printed by acpi_device_get_power() to
acpi_handle_debug(), because that function is also called when
the ACPI device object name has not been set yet and the dev_dbg()
message printed by it at that time is not useful.
