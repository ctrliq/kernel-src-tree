Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Currently PRM(Platform Runtime Mechanism) config option is listed along
with the main ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) option
at the same level. On ARM64 platforms unlike x86, ACPI option is listed
at the topmost level of configuration menu. It is rather very confusing
to see PRM option also listed along with ACPI in the topmost level.

Move the same under ACPI config option. No functional change, just changes
the level of visibility of this option under the configuration menu.

 -	  The PCC Address Space also referred as PCC Operation Region pertains

 -
 -	  The PCC Operation Region works in conjunction with the PCC Table
 -	  (Platform Communications Channel Table). PCC subspaces that are
 -	  marked for use as PCC Operation Regions must not be used as PCC
 -	  subspaces for the standard ACPI features such as CPPC, RASF, PDTT and
 -	  MPST. These standard features must always use the PCC Table instead.
 -
 -	  Enable this feature if you want to set up and install the PCC Address
 -	  Space handler to handle PCC OpRegion in the firmware.
