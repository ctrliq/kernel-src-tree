Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/f3e13bbc.failed

In the snippets like the following

	if (...)
		return / goto / break / continue ...;
	else
		...

the 'else' is redundant. Get rid of it.
