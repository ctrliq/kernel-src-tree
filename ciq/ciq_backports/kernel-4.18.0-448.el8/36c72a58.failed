Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

The AMD SPI driver stores a pointer to the spi_master in struct amd_spi
so that it can get from the latter to the former in amd_spi_fifo_xfer().

It's simpler to just pass the pointer from the sole caller
amd_spi_master_transfer() and drop the pointer from struct amd_spi.
