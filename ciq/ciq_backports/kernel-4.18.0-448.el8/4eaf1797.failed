Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/4eaf1797.failed

The ice_for_each_vf macros have comments describing the implementation. One
of the arguments has a period on the end, which is not our typical style.
Remove the unnecessary period.
