It looks like this test has been accidentally dropped when resolving
conflicts in this Makefile.

Most probably because there were 3 different patches modifying this file
in parallel:

  commit 152e8ec77640 ("selftests/bonding: add a test for bonding lladdr target")
  commit bbb774d921e2 ("net: Add tests for bonding and team address list management")
  commit 2ffd57327ff1 ("selftests: bonding: cause oops in bond_rr_gen_slave_id")

The first one was applied in 'net-next' while the two other ones were
recently applied in the 'net' tree.

But that's alright, easy to fix by re-adding the missing one!
