kvm_set_gsi_routing_irqchip_check(expect_failure=true) is used to check
the error code returned by the kernel when trying to setup an invalid
gsi routing table. The ioctl fails if "pin >= KVM_IRQCHIP_NUM_PINS", so
kvm_set_gsi_routing_irqchip_check() should test the error only when
"intid >= KVM_IRQCHIP_NUM_PINS+32". The issue is that the test check is
"intid >= KVM_IRQCHIP_NUM_PINS", so for a case like "intid =
KVM_IRQCHIP_NUM_PINS" the test wrongly assumes that the kernel will
return an error.  Fix this by using the right check.
