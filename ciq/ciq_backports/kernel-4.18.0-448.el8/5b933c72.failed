Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/5b933c72.failed

For wmfw format v2 and later the coefficient name strings have a length
field and are NOT null-terminated. Use kasprintf() to convert the
unterminated string into a null-terminated string in an allocated buffer.

The previous code handled this duplication incorrectly using kmemdup()
and getting the length from a strlen() of the (unterminated) source string.
This resulted in creating a string that continued up to the next byte in
the firmware file that just happened to be 0x00.
