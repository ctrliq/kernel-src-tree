Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/1b331eee.failed

Yes, r11 and rcx have been restored previously, but since they're being
popped anyway (into rsi) might as well pop them into their own regs --
setting them to the value they already are.

Less magical code.
