Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/f7e7ce93.failed

There are two methods to specify the location of the elf core headers:
using the "elfcorehdr=" kernel parameter, as handled by generic code in
kernel/crash_dump.c, or using the "linux,elfcorehdr" property under the
"/chosen" node in the Device Tree, as handled by architecture-specific
code in arch/arm64/mm/init.c.

Extend support for "linux,elfcorehdr" to all platforms supporting DT by
adding platform-agnostic handling for handling this property to the FDT
core code.  This can co-exist safely with the architecture-specific
handling, until the latter has been removed.

This requires moving the call to of_scan_flat_dt() up, as the code
scanning the "/chosen" node now needs to be aware of the values of
"#address-cells" and "#size-cells".
