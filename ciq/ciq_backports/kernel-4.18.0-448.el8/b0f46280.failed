Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/b0f46280.failed

Let's explain in which situations the rc/rrc will set in struct
kvm_pv_cmd so it's clear that the struct members should be set to
0. rc/rrc are independent of the IOCTL return code.

+ **Ultravisor return codes**
+ The Ultravisor return (reason) codes are provided by the kernel if a
+ Ultravisor call has been executed to achieve the results expected by
+ the command. Therefore they are independent of the IOCTL return
+ code. If KVM changes `rc`, its value will always be greater than 0
+ hence setting it to 0 before issuing a PV command is advised to be
+ able to detect a change of `rc`.
