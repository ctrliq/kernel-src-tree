Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/a4b97655.failed

Add helpers that can be layered on top of a buffer read from or to be
written to the DSP to faciliate accessing datastructures within the DSP
memory. These functions handle adding the padding bytes for the DSP,
converting to big endian, and packing arbitrary length data.
