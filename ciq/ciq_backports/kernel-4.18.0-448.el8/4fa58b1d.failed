Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/4fa58b1d.failed

The config sequences for running with and without firmware and DSP
are different. The original behavior assumed that we would only
run without DSP only in the case where firmware load failed.
This meant the non-firmware sequence was written with the assumtion
that various registers would be set to their default value.
However, to support the ability to unload the firmware, the
non-firmware register sequence must be updated to update all
required registers, including values that would be defaulted,
in case the firmware sequence, which could have already run,
has changed their value.
