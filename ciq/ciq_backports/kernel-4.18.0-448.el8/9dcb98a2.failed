Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/9dcb98a2.failed

Fix the formatting of the multi-channel test usage example. Call out
the note about parameter ordering and add detail on the settings of
parameters for the new version of dmatest.

++<<<<<<< HEAD
 +Note: the channel parameter should always be the last parameter set prior to
 +running the test (setting run=1), this is because upon setting the channel
 +parameter, that specific channel is requested using the dmaengine and a thread
 +is created with the existing parameters. This thread is set as pending
 +and will be executed once run is set to 1. Any parameters set after the thread
 +is created are not applied.
++=======
+ .. note::
+   For all tests, starting in the 5.0 kernel, either single- or multi-channel,
+   the channel parameter(s) must be set after all other parameters. It is at
+   that time that the existing parameter values are acquired for use by the
+   thread(s). All other parameters are shared. Therefore, if changes are made
+   to any of the other parameters, and an additional channel specified, the
+   (shared) parameters used for all threads will use the new values.
+   After the channels are specified, each thread is set as pending. All threads
+   begin execution when the run parameter is set to 1.
