Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/b66f9e70.failed

We are using the READ_ONCE() on the debugfs read path for accessing
sdev->host_offset, but the set is not atomic or protected in any way.

Add a small helper to do the host_offset update and be really paranoid
about the a possible race in update
