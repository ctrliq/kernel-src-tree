Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/4332ea8f.failed

The AMD SPI driver calls platform_set_drvdata() on probe even though
it's already been set by __spi_alloc_controller().  Likewise, it calls
platform_set_drvdata() on remove even though it's going to be set by
__device_release_driver().  Drop the duplicate assignments.
