Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/777a2cbb.failed

Return from a write-only transfer without waiting for
it to finish
But wait before a new transfer as the previous may
still happening and also wait before reading the data
from the FIFO
