VF was not able to send tagged traffic when it didn't
have any VLAN interfaces and VLAN anti-spoofing was enabled.
Fix this by allowing VFs with no VLAN filters to send tagged
traffic. After VF adds a VLAN interface it will be able to
send tagged traffic matching VLAN filters only.

Testing hints:
1. Spawn VF
2. Send tagged packet from a VF
3. The packet should be sent out and not dropped
4. Add a VLAN interface on VF
5. Send tagged packet on that VLAN interface
6. Packet should be sent out and not dropped
7. Send tagged packet with id different than VLAN interface
8. Packet should be dropped
