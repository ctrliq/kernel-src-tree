commit 3b49a7edec1df4f7019b3b872124231197267205
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/3b49a7ed.failed

The driver doesn't support multiple CT actions.
Multiple CT clear actions are ok as they are redundant also with
another CT actions.
