commit 1549a69b89b7e5b1b830da897529344766728a4b
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/1549a69b.failed

It is not yet clear, but it is possible to create a firmware so broken
that it will send a reply message before a FW_READY message (it is not
yet clear if FW_READY will arrive later).
Since the reply_data is allocated only after the FW_READY message, this
will lead to a NULL pointer dereference if not filtered out.
