Add a new amd pstate driver command line option to enable driver passive
working mode via MSR and shared memory interface to request desired
performance within abstract scale and the power management firmware
(SMU) convert the perf requests into actual hardware pstates.

Also the `disable` parameter can disable the pstate driver loading by
adding `amd_pstate=disable` to kernel command line.

+ 			Format: { early | on | rw | ro | off }
+ 			Controls if xmon debugger is enabled. Default is off.
+ 			Passing only "xmon" is equivalent to "xmon=early".
+ 			early	Call xmon as early as possible on boot; xmon
+ 				debugger is called from setup_arch().
+ 			on	xmon debugger hooks will be installed so xmon
+ 				is only called on a kernel crash. Default mode,
+ 				i.e. either "ro" or "rw" mode, is controlled
+ 				with CONFIG_XMON_DEFAULT_RO_MODE.
+ 			rw	xmon debugger hooks will be installed so xmon
+ 				is called only on a kernel crash, mode is write,
+ 				meaning SPR registers, memory and, other data
+ 				can be written using xmon commands.
+ 			ro 	same as "rw" option above but SPR registers,
+ 				memory, and other data can't be written using
+ 				xmon commands.
+ 			off	xmon is disabled.

+ 			disable
+ 			  Do not enable amd_pstate as the default
+ 			  scaling driver for the supported processors
+ 			passive
+ 			  Use amd_pstate as a scaling driver, driver requests a
+ 			  desired performance on this abstract scale and the power
+ 			  management firmware translates the requests into actual
+ 			  hardware states (core frequency, data fabric and memory
+ 			  clocks etc.)
