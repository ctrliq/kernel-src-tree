Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-448.el8/a718ba30.failed

Change the legacy DAI naming flag from opting in to the new scheme
(non_legacy_dai_naming), to opting out of it (legacy_dai_naming).
These drivers appear to be on the CPU side of the DAI link and
currently uses the legacy naming, so add the new flag.
