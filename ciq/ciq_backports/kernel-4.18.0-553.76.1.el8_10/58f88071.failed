A user with a completely full filesystem experienced an unexpected
shutdown when the filesystem tried to write the superblock during
runtime.
kernel shows the following dmesg:

When xfs_log_sb writes super block to disk, b_fdblocks is fetched from
m_fdblocks without any lock. As m_fdblocks can experience a positive ->
negative -> positive changing when the FS reaches fullness (see
xfs_mod_fdblocks). So there is a chance that sb_fdblocks is negative, and
because sb_fdblocks is type of unsigned long long, it reads super big.
And sb_fdblocks being bigger than sb_dblocks is a problem during log
recovery, xfs_validate_sb_write() complains.

Fix:
As sb_fdblocks will be re-calculated during mount when lazysbcount is
enabled, We just need to make xfs_validate_sb_write() happy -- make sure
sb_fdblocks is not nenative. This patch also takes care of other percpu
counters in xfs_log_sb.
