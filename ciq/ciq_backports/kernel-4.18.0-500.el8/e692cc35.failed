Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-500.el8/e692cc35.failed

The host controller device might be designed to work for the particular
products or applications. In that case its DT node is supposed to be
equipped with the tpl-support property.
