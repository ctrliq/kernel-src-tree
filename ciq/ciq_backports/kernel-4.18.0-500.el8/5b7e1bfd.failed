Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-500.el8/5b7e1bfd.failed

For some reason the "brcm,xhci-brcm-v2" compatible string has been missing
in the original bindings file. Add it to the Generic xHCI Controllers DT
schema since the controller driver expects it to be supported.
