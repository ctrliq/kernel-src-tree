commit 99581ba863f914bec762f679bd2c2c9031a2ba2a
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-500.el8/99581ba8.failed

Aside from the UTMI+ there are also ULPI, Serial and HSIC PHY types
that can be specified in the phy_type HCD property. Add them to the
enumeration of the acceptable values.
