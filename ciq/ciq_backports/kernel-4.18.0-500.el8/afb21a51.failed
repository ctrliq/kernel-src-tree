Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-500.el8/afb21a51.failed

The dual-role mode default, in the absence of the dr_mode property, is
already documented to be OTG. Use the "default" property to mark it as
such more explicitly.
