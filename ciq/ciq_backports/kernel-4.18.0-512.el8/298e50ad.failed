commit 298e50ad8eb8fa12ea68bb2da45bb8ef4edcd0ec
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-512.el8/298e50ad.failed

To clean up drivers/net/wireless move the old drivers drivers left in the
directory to a new "legacy" directory. I did consider adding
CONFIG_WLAN_VENDOR_LEGACY like other vendors have but then dropped the idea as
these are really old drivers and hopefully we get to remove them soon.

There should be no changes in compilation or in Kconfig options, merely moving files.
