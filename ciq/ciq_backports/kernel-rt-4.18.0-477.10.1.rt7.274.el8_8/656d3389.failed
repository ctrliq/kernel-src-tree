Currently, all released FW versions support only two IPsec object
modifiers, and modify_field_select get and set same value with
proper bits.

However, it is not future compatible, as new FW can have more
modifiers and "default" will cause to overwrite not-changed fields.

Fix it by setting explicitly fields that need to be overwritten.
