Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-372.16.1.el8_6/bcb74e13.failed

When switching zones or network namespaces without doing a ct clear in
between, it is now leaking a reference to the old ct entry. That's
because tcf_ct_skb_nfct_cached() returns false and
tcf_ct_flow_table_lookup() may simply overwrite it.

The fix is to, as the ct entry is not reusable, free it already at
tcf_ct_skb_nfct_cached().
