Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-372.9.1.el8/eee5d6f1.failed

The recent regression report revealed that the judgment of the
low-latency playback mode based on the runtime->stop_threshold cannot
work reliably at the prepare stage, as sw_params call may happen at
any time, and PCM dmix actually sets it up after the prepare call.
This ended up with the stall of the stream as PCM ack won't be issued
at all.

For addressing this, check the free-wheeling mode again at the PCM
trigger right before starting the stream again, and allow switching to
the non-LL mode at a late stage.
