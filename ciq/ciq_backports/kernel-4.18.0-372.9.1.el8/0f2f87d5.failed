In the most error path of current extents updating operations are not
roll back partial updates properly when some bad things happens(.e.g in
ext4_ext_insert_extent()). So we may get an inconsistent extents tree
if journal has been aborted due to IO error, which may probability lead
to BUGON later when we accessing these extent entries in errors=continue
mode. This patch drop extent buffer's verify flag before updatng the
contents in ext4_ext_get_access(), and reset it after updating in
__ext4_ext_dirty(). After this patch we could force to check the extent
buffer if extents tree updating was break off, make sure the extents are
consistent.
