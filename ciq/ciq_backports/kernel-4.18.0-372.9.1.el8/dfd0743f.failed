Since the tee subsystem does not keep a strong reference to its idle
shared memory buffers, it races with other threads that try to destroy a
shared memory through a close of its dma-buf fd or by unmapping the
memory.

In tee_shm_get_from_id() when a lookup in teedev->idr has been
successful, it is possible that the tee_shm is in the dma-buf teardown
path, but that path is blocked by the teedev mutex. Since we don't have
an API to tell if the tee_shm is in the dma-buf teardown path or not we
must find another way of detecting this condition.

Fix this by doing the reference counting directly on the tee_shm using a
new refcount_t refcount field. dma-buf is replaced by using
anon_inode_getfd() instead, this separates the life-cycle of the
underlying file from the tee_shm. tee_shm_put() is updated to hold the
mutex when decreasing the refcount to 0 and then remove the tee_shm from
teedev->idr before releasing the mutex. This means that the tee_shm can
never be found unless it has a refcount larger than 0.
