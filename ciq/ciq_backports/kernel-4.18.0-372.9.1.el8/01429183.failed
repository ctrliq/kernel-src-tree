Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-372.9.1.el8/01429183.failed

Older firmware prior to ABI 3.19 has a dependency where the scheduler
widgets need to be setup last. Moving the call to sof_widget_setup()
before the pipeline_complete() call also helps remove the need for the
'reverse' direction when walking through the widget list - this was
only working because of the topology macros but the topology does not
require any order.
