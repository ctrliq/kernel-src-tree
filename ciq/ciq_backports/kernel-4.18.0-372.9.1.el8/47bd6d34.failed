++=======
+ 
+ Workqueue Concurrency
+ =====================
+ 
+ XFS uses kernel workqueues to parallelize metadata update processes.  This
+ enables it to take advantage of storage hardware that can service many IO
+ operations simultaneously.  This interface exposes internal implementation
+ details of XFS, and as such is explicitly not part of any userspace API/ABI
+ guarantee the kernel may give userspace.  These are undocumented features of
+ the generic workqueue implementation XFS uses for concurrency, and they are
+ provided here purely for diagnostic and tuning purposes and may change at any
+ time in the future.
+ 
+ The control knobs for a filesystem's workqueues are organized by task at hand
+ and the short name of the data device.  They all can be found in:
+ 
+   /sys/bus/workqueue/devices/${task}!${device}
+ 
+ ================  ===========
+   Task            Description
+ ================  ===========
+   xfs_iwalk-$pid  Inode scans of the entire filesystem. Currently limited to
+                   mount time quotacheck.
+   xfs-blockgc     Background garbage collection of disk space that have been
+                   speculatively allocated beyond EOF or for staging copy on
+                   write operations.
+ ================  ===========
+ 
+ For example, the knobs for the quotacheck workqueue for /dev/nvme0n1 would be
+ found in /sys/bus/workqueue/devices/xfs_iwalk-1111!nvme0n1/.
+ 
+ The interesting knobs for XFS workqueues are as follows:
+ 
+ ============     ===========
+   Knob           Description
+ ============     ===========
+   max_active     Maximum number of background threads that can be started to
+                  run the work.
+   cpumask        CPUs upon which the threads are allowed to run.
+   nice           Relative priority of scheduling the threads.  These are the
+                  same nice levels that can be applied to userspace processes.
