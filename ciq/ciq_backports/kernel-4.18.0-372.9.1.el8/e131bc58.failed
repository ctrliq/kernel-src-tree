Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-372.9.1.el8/e131bc58.failed

The core already prints a dump if the DSP failed to start in
snd_sof_run_firmware(), there is no need to print it locally as well.
