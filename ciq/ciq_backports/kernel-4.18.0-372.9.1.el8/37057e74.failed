Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-372.9.1.el8/37057e74.failed

To pick up the changes in:

  5aec579e08e4f2be ("ALSA: uapi: Fix a C++ style comment in asound.h")

That is just changing a // style comment to /* */.

This silences this perf build warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/include/uapi/sound/asound.h' differs from latest version at 'include/uapi/sound/asound.h'
