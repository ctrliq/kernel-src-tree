Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-372.9.1.el8/f728b9c4.failed

The purpose of calling get_user_pages_locked() from lookup_node() was to
allow for unlocking the mmap_lock when reading a page from the disk
during a page fault (hidden behind VM_FAULT_RETRY).  The idea was to
reduce contention on the heavily-used mmap_lock.  (Thanks to Jan Kara
for clearly pointing that out, and in fact I've used some of his wording
here.)

However, it is unlikely for lookup_node() to take a page fault.  With
that in mind, change over to calling get_user_pages_fast().  This
simplifies the code, runs a little faster in the expected case, and
allows removing get_user_pages_locked() entirely, in a subsequent patch.
