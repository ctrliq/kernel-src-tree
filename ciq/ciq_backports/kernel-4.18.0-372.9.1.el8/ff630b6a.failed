Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-372.9.1.el8/ff630b6a.failed

Fix some spelling mistakes as follows:
altenate ==> alternate
compatbile ==> compatible
perfoms ==> performs
dont'register ==> don't register
periodicaly ==> periodically
arount ==> around
