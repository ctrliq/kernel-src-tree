Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-372.9.1.el8/49095f64.failed

Move from static to dynamic memory allocations for TIR.
This is in preparation to supporting on-demand TIR operations in
downstream patches, where every RSS context will be init with an
empty set of TIRs.
