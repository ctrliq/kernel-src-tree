Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-372.9.1.el8/be1ac692.failed

[Why]
The HW interrupt gets disabled after S3/S4/reset so we don't receive
notifications for HPD or AUX from DMUB - leading to timeout and
black screen with (or without) DPIA links connected.

[How]
Re-enable the interrupt after S3/S4/reset like we do for the other
DC interrupts.

Guard both instances of the outbox interrupt enable or we'll hang
during restore on ASIC that don't support it.
