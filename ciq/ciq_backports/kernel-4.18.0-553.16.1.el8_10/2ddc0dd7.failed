Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-553.16.1.el8_10/2ddc0dd7.failed

In smc_ib_find_route(), the neighbour found by neigh_lookup() and rtable
resolved by ip_route_output_flow() are not released or put before return.
It may cause the refcount leak, so fix it.
