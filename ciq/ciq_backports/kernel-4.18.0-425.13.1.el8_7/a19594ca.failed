Tracing of the stutterp workload showed the following delays

    116 usect_delayed=112000 reason=VMSCAN_THROTTLE_NOPROGRESS
   5907 usect_delayed=108000 reason=VMSCAN_THROTTLE_NOPROGRESS
  71741 usect_delayed=104000 reason=VMSCAN_THROTTLE_NOPROGRESS

All the throttling hit the full timeout and then there was wakeup delays
meaning that the wakeups are premature as no other reclaimer such as
kswapd has made progress.  This patch increases the maximum timeout.
