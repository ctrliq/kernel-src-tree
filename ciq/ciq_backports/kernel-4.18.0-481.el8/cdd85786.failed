Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-481.el8/cdd85786.failed

After successful #VE handling, tdx_handle_virt_exception() has to move
RIP to the next instruction. The handler needs to know the length of the
instruction.

If the #VE happened due to instruction execution, the GET_VEINFO TDX
module call provides info on the instruction in R10, including its length.

For #VE due to EPT violation, the info in R10 is not populand and the
kernel must decode the instruction manually to find out its length.

Restructure the code to make it explicit that the instruction length
depends on the type of #VE. Make individual #VE handlers return
the instruction length on success or -errno on failure.
