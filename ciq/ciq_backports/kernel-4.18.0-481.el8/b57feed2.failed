Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-481.el8/b57feed2.failed

The decompressed kernel initially relies on the identity map set up by
the boot/compressed kernel for accessing things like boot_params. With
the recent introduction of SEV-SNP support, the decompressed kernel
also needs to access the setup_data entries pointed to by
boot_params->hdr.setup_data.

This can lead to a crash in the kexec kernel during early boot due to
these entries not currently being included in the initial identity map,
see thread at Link below.

Include mappings for the setup_data entries in the initial identity map.

  [ bp: Massage commit message and use a helper var for better readability. ]
