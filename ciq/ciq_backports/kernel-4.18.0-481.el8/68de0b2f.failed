The SNP_GET_DERIVED_KEY ioctl interface can be used by the SNP guest to
ask the firmware to provide a key derived from a root key. The derived
key may be used by the guest for any purposes it chooses, such as a
sealing key or communicating with the external entities.

See SEV-SNP firmware spec for more information.

  [ bp: No need to memset "req" - it will get overwritten. ]
