Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-481.el8/4c5b9aac.failed

Port I/O instructions trigger #VE in the TDX environment. In response to
the exception, kernel emulates these instructions using hypercalls.

But during early boot, on the decompression stage, it is cumbersome to
deal with #VE. It is cleaner to go to hypercalls directly, bypassing #VE
handling.

Hook up TDX-specific port I/O helpers if booting in TDX environment.
