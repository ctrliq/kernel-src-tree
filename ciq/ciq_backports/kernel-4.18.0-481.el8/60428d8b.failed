commit 60428d8bc27f52e8f1540f98e1b6ef0156d43f0d
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-481.el8/60428d8b.failed

tdx_early_handle_ve() does not increment RIP after successfully
handling the exception.  That leads to infinite loop of exceptions.

Move RIP when exceptions are successfully handled.

[ dhansen: make problem statement more clear ]
