On some architectures (like ARM64), it can support CONT-PTE/PMD size
hugetlb, which means it can support not only PMD/PUD size hugetlb (2M and
1G), but also CONT-PTE/PMD size(64K and 32M) if a 4K page size specified.

So when looking up a CONT-PTE size hugetlb page by follow_page(), it will
use pte_offset_map_lock() to get the pte entry lock for the CONT-PTE size
hugetlb in follow_page_pte().  However this pte entry lock is incorrect
for the CONT-PTE size hugetlb, since we should use huge_pte_lock() to get
the correct lock, which is mm->page_table_lock.

That means the pte entry of the CONT-PTE size hugetlb under current pte
lock is unstable in follow_page_pte(), we can continue to migrate or
poison the pte entry of the CONT-PTE size hugetlb, which can cause some
potential race issues, even though they are under the 'pte lock'.

For example, suppose thread A is trying to look up a CONT-PTE size hugetlb
page by move_pages() syscall under the lock, however antoher thread B can
migrate the CONT-PTE hugetlb page at the same time, which will cause
thread A to get an incorrect page, if thread A also wants to do page
migration, then data inconsistency error occurs.

Moreover we have the same issue for CONT-PMD size hugetlb in
follow_huge_pmd().

To fix above issues, rename the follow_huge_pmd() as follow_huge_pmd_pte()
to handle PMD and PTE level size hugetlb, which uses huge_pte_lock() to
get the correct pte entry lock to make the pte entry stable.

Mike said:

Support for CONT_PMD/_PTE was added with bb9dd3df8ee9 ("arm64: hugetlb:
refactor find_num_contig()").  Patch series "Support for contiguous pte
hugepages", v4.  However, I do not believe these code paths were
executed until migration support was added with 5480280d3f2d ("arm64/mm:
enable HugeTLB migration for contiguous bit HugeTLB pages") I would go
with 5480280d3f2d for the Fixes: targe.
