Intel TDX protects guest memory from VMM access. Any memory that is
required for communication with the VMM must be explicitly shared.

It is a two-step process: the guest sets the shared bit in the page
table entry and notifies VMM about the change. The notification happens
using MapGPA hypercall.

Conversion back to private memory requires clearing the shared bit,
notifying VMM with MapGPA hypercall following with accepting the memory
with AcceptPage hypercall.

Provide a TDX version of x86_platform.guest.* callbacks. It makes
__set_memory_enc_pgtable() work right in TDX guest.

+  * Virtualization Exceptions (#VE) are delivered to TDX guests due to

+  * kernel:
+  *
+  *  * Specific instructions (WBINVD, for example)
+  *  * Specific MSR accesses
+  *  * Specific CPUID leaf accesses
+  *  * Access to specific guest physical addresses
+  *
+  * In the settings that Linux will run in, virtualization exceptions are
+  * never generated on accesses to normal, TD-private memory that has been
+  * accepted (by BIOS or with tdx_enc_status_changed()).
+  *
+  * Syscall entry code has a critical window where the kernel stack is not
+  * yet set up. Any exception in this window leads to hard to debug issues
+  * and can be exploited for privilege escalation. Exceptions in the NMI
+  * entry code also cause issues. Returning from the exception handler with
+  * IRET will re-enable NMIs and nested NMI will corrupt the NMI stack.
+  *
+  * For these reasons, the kernel avoids #VEs during the syscall gap and
+  * the NMI entry code. Entry code paths do not access TD-shared memory,
+  * MMIO regions, use #VE triggering MSRs, instructions, or CPUID leaves
+  * that might generate #VE. VMM can remove memory from TD at any point,
+  * but access to unaccepted (or missing) private memory leads to VM
+  * termination, not to #VE.
+  *
+  * Similarly to page faults and breakpoints, #VEs are allowed in NMI
+  * handlers once the kernel is ready to deal with nested NMIs.
+  *
+  * During #VE delivery, all interrupts, including NMIs, are blocked until
+  * TDGETVEINFO is called. It prevents #VE nesting until the kernel reads
+  * the VE info.
+  *
+  * If a guest kernel action which would normally cause a #VE occurs in
+  * the interrupt-disabled region before TDGETVEINFO, a #DF (fault
+  * exception) is delivered to the guest which will result in an oops.
+  *
+  * The entry code has been audited carefully for following these expectations.
+  * Changes in the entry code have to be audited for correctness vs. this
+  * aspect. Similarly to #PF, #VE in these places will expose kernel to
+  * privilege escalation or may lead to random crashes.
