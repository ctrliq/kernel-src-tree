Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-481.el8/77a512e3.failed

There are a few MSRs and control register bits that the kernel
normally needs to modify during boot. But, TDX disallows
modification of these registers to help provide consistent security
guarantees. Fortunately, TDX ensures that these are all in the correct
state before the kernel loads, which means the kernel does not need to
modify them.

The conditions to avoid are:

 * Any writes to the EFER MSR
 * Clearing CR4.MCE

This theoretically makes the guest boot more fragile. If, for instance,
EFER was set up incorrectly and a WRMSR was performed, it will trigger
early exception panic or a triple fault, if it's before early
exceptions are set up. However, this is likely to trip up the guest
BIOS long before control reaches the kernel. In any case, these kinds
of problems are unlikely to occur in production environments, and
developers have good debug tools to fix them quickly.

Change the common boot code to work on TDX and non-TDX systems.
This should have no functional effect on non-TDX systems.
