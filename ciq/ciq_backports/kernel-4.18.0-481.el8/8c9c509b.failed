The previously defined Confidential Computing blob is provided to the
kernel via a setup_data structure or EFI config table entry. Currently,
these are both checked for by boot/compressed kernel to access the CPUID
table address within it for use with SEV-SNP CPUID enforcement.

To also enable that enforcement for the run-time kernel, similar
access to the CPUID table is needed early on while it's still using
the identity-mapped page table set up by boot/compressed, where global
pointers need to be accessed via fixup_pointer().

This isn't much of an issue for accessing setup_data, and the EFI config
table helper code currently used in boot/compressed *could* be used in
this case as well since they both rely on identity-mapping. However, it
has some reliance on EFI helpers/string constants that would need to be
accessed via fixup_pointer(), and fixing it up while making it shareable
between boot/compressed and run-time kernel is fragile and introduces a
good bit of ugliness.

Instead, add a boot_params->cc_blob_address pointer that the
boot/compressed kernel can initialize so that the run-time kernel can
access the CC blob from there instead of re-scanning the EFI config
table.

Also document these in Documentation/x86/zero-page.rst. While there,
add missing documentation for the acpi_rsdp_addr field, which serves a
similar purpose in providing the run-time kernel a pointer to the ACPI
RSDP table so that it does not need to [re-]scan the EFI configuration
table.
