For a system with many CPUs and block devices, the time to do
blkcg_rstat_flush() from cgroup_rstat_flush() can be rather long. It
can be especially problematic as interrupt is disabled during the flush.
It was reported that it might take seconds to complete in some extreme
cases leading to hard lockup messages.

As it is likely that not all the percpu blkg_iostat_set's has been
updated since the last flush, those stale blkg_iostat_set's don't need
to be flushed in this case. This patch optimizes blkcg_rstat_flush()
by keeping a lockless list of recently updated blkg_iostat_set's in a
newly added percpu blkcg->lhead pointer.

The blkg_iostat_set is added to a lockless list on the update side
in blk_cgroup_bio_start(). It is removed from the lockless list when
flushed in blkcg_rstat_flush(). Due to racing, it is possible that
blk_iostat_set's in the lockless list may have no new IO stats to be
flushed, but that is OK.

To protect against destruction of blkg, a percpu reference is gotten
when putting into the lockless list and put back when removed.

When booting up an instrumented test kernel with this patch on a
2-socket 96-thread system with cgroup v2, out of the 2051 calls to
cgroup_rstat_flush() after bootup, 1788 of the calls were exited
immediately because of empty lockless list. After an all-cpu kernel
build, the ratio became 6295424/6340513. That was more than 99%.

+ /*
+  * Lockless lists for tracking IO stats update
+  *
+  * New IO stats are stored in the percpu iostat_cpu within blkcg_gq (blkg).
+  * There are multiple blkg's (one for each block device) attached to each
+  * blkcg. The rstat code keeps track of which cpu has IO stats updated,
+  * but it doesn't know which blkg has the updated stats. If there are many
+  * block devices in a system, the cost of iterating all the blkg's to flush
+  * out the IO stats can be high. To reduce such overhead, a set of percpu
+  * lockless lists (lhead) per blkcg are used to track the set of recently
+  * updated iostat_cpu's since the last flush. An iostat_cpu will be put
+  * onto the lockless list on the update side [blk_cgroup_bio_start()] if
+  * not there yet and then removed when being flushed [blkcg_rstat_flush()].
+  * References to blkg are gotten and then put back in the process to
+  * protect against blkg removal.
+  *
+  * Return: 0 if successful or -ENOMEM if allocation fails.
