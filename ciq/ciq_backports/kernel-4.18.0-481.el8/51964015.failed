The spacing is off in the memory encryption features message on AMD
platforms that support memory encryption, e.g.:

  "Memory Encryption Features active:AMD  SEV SEV-ES"

There is no space before "AMD" and two spaces after it. Fix this so that
the message is spaced properly:

  "Memory Encryption Features active: AMD SEV SEV-ES"
