Once upon a time, we only support accounting thrashing of page cache. 
Then Joonsoo introduced workingset detection for anonymous pages and we
gained the ability to account thrashing of them[1].

Likes PSI, we count submission time as thrashing delay because when the
device is congested, or the submitting cgroup IO-throttled, submission can
be a significant part of overall IO time.

Without this patch, swap thrashing through frontswap or some block
device supporting rw_page operation isn't measured correctly.

This patch is based on "delayacct: support re-entrance detection of
thrashing accounting".
