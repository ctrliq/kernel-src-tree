Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-481.el8/41394e33.failed

Confidential Computing (CC) features (like string I/O unroll support,
memory encryption/decryption support, etc) are conditionally enabled
in the kernel using cc_platform_has() API. Since TDX guests also need
to use these CC features, extend cc_platform_has() API and add TDX
guest-specific CC attributes support.

CC API also provides an interface to deal with encryption mask. Extend
it to cover TDX.

Details about which bit in the page table entry to be used to indicate
shared/private state is determined by using the TDINFO TDCALL.
