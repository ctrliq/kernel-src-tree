load_unaligned_zeropad() can lead to unwanted loads across page boundaries.
The unwanted loads are typically harmless. But, they might be made to
totally unrelated or even unmapped memory. load_unaligned_zeropad()
relies on exception fixup (#PF, #GP and now #VE) to recover from these
unwanted loads.

In TDX guests, the second page can be shared page and a VMM may configure
it to trigger #VE.

The kernel assumes that #VE on a shared page is an MMIO access and tries to
decode instruction to handle it. In case of load_unaligned_zeropad() it
may result in confusion as it is not MMIO access.

Fix it by detecting split page MMIO accesses and failing them.
load_unaligned_zeropad() will recover using exception fixups.

The issue was discovered by analysis and reproduced artificially. It was
not triggered during testing.
