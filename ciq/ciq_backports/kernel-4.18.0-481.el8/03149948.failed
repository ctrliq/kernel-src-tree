TDX hypervisors cannot emulate instructions directly. This includes
port I/O which is normally emulated in the hypervisor. All port I/O
instructions inside TDX trigger the #VE exception in the guest and
would be normally emulated there.

Use a hypercall to emulate port I/O. Extend the
tdx_handle_virt_exception() and add support to handle the #VE due to
port I/O instructions.

String I/O operations are not supported in TDX. Unroll them by declaring
CC_ATTR_GUEST_UNROLL_STRING_IO confidential computing attribute.

== Userspace Implications ==

The ioperm() facility allows userspace access to I/O instructions like
inb/outb.  Among other things, this allows writing userspace device
drivers.

This series has no special handling for ioperm(). Users will be able to
successfully request I/O permissions but will induce a #VE on their
first I/O instruction which leads SIGSEGV. If this is undesirable users
can enable kernel lockdown feature with 'lockdown=integrity' kernel
command line option. It makes ioperm() fail.

More robust handling of this situation (denying ioperm() in all TDX
guests) will be addressed in follow-on work.
