The io-specific memcpy/memset functions use string mmio accesses to do
their work. Under SEV, the hypervisor can't emulate these instructions
because they read/write directly from/to encrypted memory.

KVM will inject a page fault exception into the guest when it is asked
to emulate string mmio instructions for an SEV guest:

  BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffc90000065068
  #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode
  #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page
  PGD 8000100000067 P4D 8000100000067 PUD 80001000fb067 PMD 80001000fc067 PTE 80000000fed40173
  Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTI
  CPU: 0 PID: 1 Comm: swapper/0 Not tainted 5.17.0-rc7 #3

As string mmio for an SEV guest can not be supported by the
hypervisor, unroll the instructions for CC_ATTR_GUEST_UNROLL_STRING_IO
enabled kernels.

This issue appears when kernels are launched in recent libvirt-managed
SEV virtual machines, because virt-install started to add a tpm-crb
device to the guest by default and proactively because, raisins:

  https://github.com/virt-manager/virt-manager/commit/eb58c09f488b0633ed1eea012cd311e48864401e

and as that commit says, the default adding of a TPM can be disabled
with "virt-install ... --tpm none".

The kernel driver for tpm-crb uses memcpy_to/from_io() functions to
access MMIO memory, resulting in a page-fault injected by KVM and
crashing the kernel at boot.
