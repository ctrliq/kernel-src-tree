In the case of firmware-upload, an instance of struct fw_upload is
allocated in firmware_upload_register(). This data needs to be freed
in fw_dev_release(). Create a new fw_upload_free() function in
sysfs_upload.c to handle the firmware-upload specific memory frees
and incorporate the missing kfree call for the fw_upload structure.
