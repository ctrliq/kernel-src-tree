In the following code within firmware_upload_unregister(), the call to
device_unregister() could result in the dev_release function freeing the
fw_upload_priv structure before it is dereferenced for the call to
module_put(). This bug was found by the kernel test robot using
CONFIG_KASAN while running the firmware selftests.

  device_unregister(&fw_sysfs->dev);
  module_put(fw_upload_priv->module);

The problem is fixed by copying fw_upload_priv->module to a local variable
for use when calling device_unregister().
