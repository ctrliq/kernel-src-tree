In TDX guests, most CPUID leaf/sub-leaf combinations are virtualized
by the TDX module while some trigger #VE.

Implement the #VE handling for EXIT_REASON_CPUID by handing it through
the hypercall, which in turn lets the TDX module handle it by invoking
the host VMM.

More details on CPUID Virtualization can be found in the TDX module
specification, the section titled "CPUID Virtualization".

Note that VMM that handles the hypercall is not trusted. It can return
data that may steer the guest kernel in wrong direct. Only allow  VMM
to control range reserved for hypervisor communication.

Return all-zeros for any CPUID outside the hypervisor range. It matches
CPU behaviour for non-supported leaf.
