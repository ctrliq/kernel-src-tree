Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Take the gen12+ RC CCS modifier into account when calculating the
watermarks. Othwerwise we'll calculate the watermarks thinking this
Y-tiled modifier is linear.

The rc_surface part is actually a nop since that is not used
for any glk+ platform.

v2: Split RC CCS vs. MC CCS to separate patches
