The HLT instruction is a privileged instruction, executing it stops
instruction execution and places the processor in a HALT state. It
is used in kernel for cases like reboot, idle loop and exception fixup
handlers. For the idle case, interrupts will be enabled (using STI)
before the HLT instruction (this is also called safe_halt()).

To support the HLT instruction in TDX guests, it needs to be emulated
using TDVMCALL (hypercall to VMM). More details about it can be found
in Intel Trust Domain Extensions (Intel TDX) Guest-Host-Communication
Interface (GHCI) specification, section TDVMCALL[Instruction.HLT].

In TDX guests, executing HLT instruction will generate a #VE, which is
used to emulate the HLT instruction. But #VE based emulation will not
work for the safe_halt() flavor, because it requires STI instruction to
be executed just before the TDCALL. Since idle loop is the only user of
safe_halt() variant, handle it as a special case.

To avoid *safe_halt() call in the idle function, define the
tdx_guest_idle() and use it to override the "x86_idle" function pointer
for a valid TDX guest.

Alternative choices like PV ops have been considered for adding
safe_halt() support. But it was rejected because HLT paravirt calls
only exist under PARAVIRT_XXL, and enabling it in TDX guest just for
safe_halt() use case is not worth the cost.
