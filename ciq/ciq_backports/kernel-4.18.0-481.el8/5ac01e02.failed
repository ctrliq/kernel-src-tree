Support for drivers to define bulk read/write callbacks in regmap_config
was introduced by the commit d77e74561368 ("regmap: Add bulk read/write
callbacks into regmap_config"), but this commit wrongly dropped a check
in regmap_bulk_read() to determine whether bulk reads can be done or not.

Before that commit, it was checked if map->bus was set. Now has to check
if a map->read callback has been set.
