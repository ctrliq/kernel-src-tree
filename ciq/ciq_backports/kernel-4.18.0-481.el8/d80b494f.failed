Version 2 of GHCB specification defines Non-Automatic-Exit (NAE) to get
extended guest report which is similar to the SNP_GET_REPORT ioctl. The
main difference is related to the additional data that will be returned.

That additional data returned is a certificate blob that can be used by
the SNP guest user. The certificate blob layout is defined in the GHCB
specification. The driver simply treats the blob as a opaque data and
copies it to userspace.
