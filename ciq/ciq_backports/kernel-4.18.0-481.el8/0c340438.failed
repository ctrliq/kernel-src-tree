Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

The fwnode_connection_find_match() function handles two cases: named
references and graph endpoints. In the second case, the match function
passed in is called with the id to check for the match. However, the
match function for the recently added type-c retimer class assumes the
connection has already been matched (which is only true for the first
case).

The result is that with that change, all type-c nodes with graph
endpoints defer probe indefinitely, independently of having a retimer
connection or not.

Add the missing check, like is done by the type-c mux and usb role
switch code, to fix the issue.
