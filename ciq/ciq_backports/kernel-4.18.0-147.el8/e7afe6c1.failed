While trying to reproduce a reported kernel panic on arm64, I discovered
that AUTH_GSS basically doesn't work at all with older enctypes on arm64
systems with CONFIG_VMAP_STACK enabled.  It turns out there still a few
places using stack memory with scatterlists, causing krb5_encrypt() and
krb5_decrypt() to produce incorrect results (or a BUG if CONFIG_DEBUG_SG
is enabled).

Tested with cthon on v4.0/v4.1/v4.2 with krb5/krb5i/krb5p using
des3-cbc-sha1 and arcfour-hmac-md5.
