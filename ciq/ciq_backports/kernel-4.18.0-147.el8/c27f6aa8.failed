Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/c27f6aa8.failed

The next patch needs another copy of this, provide a simple helper to
reduce the coding. uapi_add_get_elm() returns an existing entry or adds a
new one.
