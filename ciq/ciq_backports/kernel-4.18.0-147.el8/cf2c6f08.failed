+ /**
+  * DOC: eBPF Syscall Commands
+  *
+  * BPF_MAP_CREATE
+  *	Description
+  *		Create a map and return a file descriptor that refers to the
+  *		map. The close-on-exec file descriptor flag (see **fcntl**\ (2))
+  *		is automatically enabled for the new file descriptor.
+  *
+  *		Applying **close**\ (2) to the file descriptor returned by
+  *		**BPF_MAP_CREATE** will delete the map (but see NOTES).
+  *
+  *	Return
+  *		A new file descriptor (a nonnegative integer), or -1 if an
+  *		error occurred (in which case, *errno* is set appropriately).
+  *
+  * BPF_MAP_LOOKUP_ELEM
+  *	Description
+  *		Look up an element with a given *key* in the map referred to
+  *		by the file descriptor *map_fd*.
+  *
+  *		The *flags* argument may be specified as one of the
+  *		following:
+  *
+  *		**BPF_F_LOCK**
+  *			Look up the value of a spin-locked map without
+  *			returning the lock. This must be specified if the
+  *			elements contain a spinlock.
+  *
+  *	Return
+  *		Returns zero on success. On error, -1 is returned and *errno*
+  *		is set appropriately.
+  *
+  * BPF_MAP_UPDATE_ELEM
+  *	Description
+  *		Create or update an element (key/value pair) in a specified map.
+  *
+  *		The *flags* argument should be specified as one of the
+  *		following:
+  *
+  *		**BPF_ANY**
+  *			Create a new element or update an existing element.
+  *		**BPF_NOEXIST**
+  *			Create a new element only if it did not exist.
+  *		**BPF_EXIST**
+  *			Update an existing element.
+  *		**BPF_F_LOCK**
+  *			Update a spin_lock-ed map element.
+  *
+  *	Return
+  *		Returns zero on success. On error, -1 is returned and *errno*
+  *		is set appropriately.
+  *
+  *		May set *errno* to **EINVAL**, **EPERM**, **ENOMEM**,
+  *		**E2BIG**, **EEXIST**, or **ENOENT**.
+  *
+  *		**E2BIG**
+  *			The number of elements in the map reached the
+  *			*max_entries* limit specified at map creation time.
+  *		**EEXIST**
+  *			If *flags* specifies **BPF_NOEXIST** and the element
+  *			with *key* already exists in the map.
+  *		**ENOENT**
+  *			If *flags* specifies **BPF_EXIST** and the element with
+  *			*key* does not exist in the map.
+  *
+  * BPF_MAP_DELETE_ELEM
+  *	Description
+  *		Look up and delete an element by key in a specified map.
+  *
+  *	Return
+  *		Returns zero on success. On error, -1 is returned and *errno*
+  *		is set appropriately.
+  *
+  * BPF_MAP_GET_NEXT_KEY
+  *	Description
+  *		Look up an element by key in a specified map and return the key
+  *		of the next element. Can be used to iterate over all elements
+  *		in the map.
+  *
+  *	Return
+  *		Returns zero on success. On error, -1 is returned and *errno*
+  *		is set appropriately.
+  *
+  *		The following cases can be used to iterate over all elements of
+  *		the map:
+  *
+  *		* If *key* is not found, the operation returns zero and sets
+  *		  the *next_key* pointer to the key of the first element.
+  *		* If *key* is found, the operation returns zero and sets the
+  *		  *next_key* pointer to the key of the next element.
+  *		* If *key* is the last element, returns -1 and *errno* is set
+  *		  to **ENOENT**.
+  *
+  *		May set *errno* to **ENOMEM**, **EFAULT**, **EPERM**, or
+  *		**EINVAL** on error.
+  *
+  * BPF_PROG_LOAD
+  *	Description
+  *		Verify and load an eBPF program, returning a new file
+  *		descriptor associated with the program.
+  *
+  *		Applying **close**\ (2) to the file descriptor returned by
+  *		**BPF_PROG_LOAD** will unload the eBPF program (but see NOTES).
+  *
+  *		The close-on-exec file descriptor flag (see **fcntl**\ (2)) is
+  *		automatically enabled for the new file descriptor.
+  *
+  *	Return
+  *		A new file descriptor (a nonnegative integer), or -1 if an
+  *		error occurred (in which case, *errno* is set appropriately).
+  *
+  * BPF_OBJ_PIN
+  *	Description
+  *		Pin an eBPF program or map referred by the specified *bpf_fd*
+  *		to the provided *pathname* on the filesystem.
+  *
+  *		The *pathname* argument must not contain a dot (".").
+  *
+  *		On success, *pathname* retains a reference to the eBPF object,
+  *		preventing deallocation of the object when the original
+  *		*bpf_fd* is closed. This allow the eBPF object to live beyond
+  *		**close**\ (\ *bpf_fd*\ ), and hence the lifetime of the parent
+  *		process.
+  *
+  *		Applying **unlink**\ (2) or similar calls to the *pathname*
+  *		unpins the object from the filesystem, removing the reference.
+  *		If no other file descriptors or filesystem nodes refer to the
+  *		same object, it will be deallocated (see NOTES).
+  *
+  *		The filesystem type for the parent directory of *pathname* must
+  *		be **BPF_FS_MAGIC**.
+  *
+  *	Return
+  *		Returns zero on success. On error, -1 is returned and *errno*
+  *		is set appropriately.
+  *
+  * BPF_OBJ_GET
+  *	Description
+  *		Open a file descriptor for the eBPF object pinned to the
+  *		specified *pathname*.
+  *
+  *	Return
+  *		A new file descriptor (a nonnegative integer), or -1 if an
+  *		error occurred (in which case, *errno* is set appropriately).
+  *
+  * BPF_PROG_ATTACH
+  *	Description
+  *		Attach an eBPF program to a *target_fd* at the specified
+  *		*attach_type* hook.
+  *
+  *		The *attach_type* specifies the eBPF attachment point to
+  *		attach the program to, and must be one of *bpf_attach_type*
+  *		(see below).
+  *
+  *		The *attach_bpf_fd* must be a valid file descriptor for a
+  *		loaded eBPF program of a cgroup, flow dissector, LIRC, sockmap
+  *		or sock_ops type corresponding to the specified *attach_type*.
+  *
+  *		The *target_fd* must be a valid file descriptor for a kernel
+  *		object which depends on the attach type of *attach_bpf_fd*:

+  *
+  *		**BPF_PROG_TYPE_LIRC_MODE2**
+  *
+  *			LIRC device path (eg /dev/lircN). Requires the kernel
+  *			to be compiled with **CONFIG_BPF_LIRC_MODE2**.

+  *		**BPF_PROG_TYPE_SK_SKB**,
+  *		**BPF_PROG_TYPE_SK_MSG**
+  *
+  *			eBPF map of socket type (eg **BPF_MAP_TYPE_SOCKHASH**).
+  *
+  *	Return
+  *		Returns zero on success. On error, -1 is returned and *errno*
+  *		is set appropriately.
+  *
+  * BPF_PROG_DETACH
+  *	Description
+  *		Detach the eBPF program associated with the *target_fd* at the
+  *		hook specified by *attach_type*. The program must have been

+  *		is set appropriately.
+  *
+  * BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN
+  *	Description
+  *		Run the eBPF program associated with the *prog_fd* a *repeat*
+  *		number of times against a provided program context *ctx_in* and

+  *		be provided in the corresponding variables *ctx_size_in*,
+  *		*ctx_size_out*, *data_size_in*, and/or *data_size_out*. If any
+  *		of these parameters are not provided (ie set to NULL), the
+  *		corresponding size field must be zero.
+  *
+  *		Some program types have particular requirements:
+  *
+  *		**BPF_PROG_TYPE_SK_LOOKUP**
+  *			*data_in* and *data_out* must be NULL.
+  *
+  *		**BPF_PROG_TYPE_RAW_TRACEPOINT**,

+  *
+  * BPF_PROG_GET_NEXT_ID
+  *	Description
+  *		Fetch the next eBPF program currently loaded into the kernel.
+  *
+  *		Looks for the eBPF program with an id greater than *start_id*

+  *	Description
+  *		Fetch the next eBPF map currently loaded into the kernel.
+  *
+  *		Looks for the eBPF map with an id greater than *start_id*
+  *		and updates *next_id* on success. If no other eBPF maps
+  *		remain with ids higher than *start_id*, returns -1 and sets

+  *
+  *	Return
+  *		Returns zero on success. On error, or when no id remains, -1
+  *		is returned and *errno* is set appropriately.
+  *
+  * BPF_PROG_GET_FD_BY_ID
+  *	Description
+  *		Open a file descriptor for the eBPF program corresponding to
+  *		*prog_id*.
+  *
+  *	Return
+  *		A new file descriptor (a nonnegative integer), or -1 if an
+  *		error occurred (in which case, *errno* is set appropriately).
+  *
+  * BPF_MAP_GET_FD_BY_ID
+  *	Description
+  *		Open a file descriptor for the eBPF map corresponding to
+  *		*map_id*.
+  *
+  *	Return

+  *		Obtain information about the eBPF object corresponding to
+  *		*bpf_fd*.
+  *
+  *		Populates up to *info_len* bytes of *info*, which will be in
+  *		one of the following formats depending on the eBPF object type
+  *		of *bpf_fd*:
+  *
+  *		* **struct bpf_prog_info**
+  *		* **struct bpf_map_info**
+  *		* **struct bpf_btf_info**
+  *		* **struct bpf_link_info**
+  *
+  *	Return
+  *		Returns zero on success. On error, -1 is returned and *errno*
+  *		is set appropriately.
+  *
+  * BPF_PROG_QUERY
+  *	Description
+  *		Obtain information about eBPF programs associated with the
+  *		specified *attach_type* hook.
+  *
+  *		The *target_fd* must be a valid file descriptor for a kernel
+  *		object which depends on the attach type of *attach_bpf_fd*:
+  *
+  *		**BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_DEVICE**,
+  *		**BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SKB**,
+  *		**BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SOCK**,
+  *		**BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SOCK_ADDR**,
+  *		**BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SOCKOPT**,
+  *		**BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SYSCTL**,
+  *		**BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCK_OPS**
+  *
+  *			Control Group v2 hierarchy with the eBPF controller

+  *
+  *			LIRC device path (eg /dev/lircN). Requires the kernel
+  *			to be compiled with **CONFIG_BPF_LIRC_MODE2**.
+  *
+  *		**BPF_PROG_QUERY** always fetches the number of programs
+  *		attached and the *attach_flags* which were used to attach those
+  *		programs. Additionally, if *prog_ids* is nonzero and the number
+  *		of attached programs is less than *prog_cnt*, populates
+  *		*prog_ids* with the eBPF program ids of the programs attached

+  *
+  *		The *prog_fd* must be a valid file descriptor associated with
+  *		a loaded eBPF program of type **BPF_PROG_TYPE_RAW_TRACEPOINT**.
+  *
+  *		No ABI guarantees are made about the content of tracepoint

+  *
+  *		Applying **close**\ (2) to the file descriptor returned by
+  *		**BPF_RAW_TRACEPOINT_OPEN** will delete the map (but see NOTES).
+  *
+  *	Return
+  *		A new file descriptor (a nonnegative integer), or -1 if an
+  *		error occurred (in which case, *errno* is set appropriately).
+  *
+  * BPF_BTF_LOAD
+  *	Description
+  *		Verify and load BPF Type Format (BTF) metadata into the kernel,
+  *		returning a new file descriptor associated with the metadata.
+  *		BTF is described in more detail at
+  *		https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/bpf/btf.html.
+  *
+  *		The *btf* parameter must point to valid memory providing
+  *		*btf_size* bytes of BTF binary metadata.
+  *
+  *		The returned file descriptor can be passed to other **bpf**\ ()
+  *		subcommands such as **BPF_PROG_LOAD** or **BPF_MAP_CREATE** to
+  *		associate the BTF with those objects.
+  *
+  *		Similar to **BPF_PROG_LOAD**, **BPF_BTF_LOAD** has optional
+  *		parameters to specify a *btf_log_buf*, *btf_log_size* and
+  *		*btf_log_level* which allow the kernel to return freeform log
+  *		output regarding the BTF verification process.
+  *
+  *	Return
+  *		A new file descriptor (a nonnegative integer), or -1 if an
+  *		error occurred (in which case, *errno* is set appropriately).
+  *
+  * BPF_BTF_GET_FD_BY_ID
+  *	Description
+  *		Open a file descriptor for the BPF Type Format (BTF)
+  *		corresponding to *btf_id*.
+  *
+  *	Return
+  *		A new file descriptor (a nonnegative integer), or -1 if an
+  *		error occurred (in which case, *errno* is set appropriately).
+  *
+  * BPF_TASK_FD_QUERY
+  *	Description
+  *		Obtain information about eBPF programs associated with the
+  *		target process identified by *pid* and *fd*.
+  *
+  *		If the *pid* and *fd* are associated with a tracepoint, kprobe
+  *		or uprobe perf event, then the *prog_id* and *fd_type* will
+  *		be populated with the eBPF program id and file descriptor type
+  *		of type **bpf_task_fd_type**. If associated with a kprobe or
+  *		uprobe, the  *probe_offset* and *probe_addr* will also be
+  *		populated. Optionally, if *buf* is provided, then up to
+  *		*buf_len* bytes of *buf* will be populated with the name of
+  *		the tracepoint, kprobe or uprobe.
+  *
+  *		The resulting *prog_id* may be introspected in deeper detail
+  *		using **BPF_PROG_GET_FD_BY_ID** and **BPF_OBJ_GET_INFO_BY_FD**.
+  *
+  *	Return
+  *		Returns zero on success. On error, -1 is returned and *errno*
+  *		is set appropriately.
+  *
+  * BPF_MAP_LOOKUP_AND_DELETE_ELEM
+  *	Description
+  *		Look up an element with the given *key* in the map referred to
+  *		by the file descriptor *fd*, and if found, delete the element.
+  *
+  *		For **BPF_MAP_TYPE_QUEUE** and **BPF_MAP_TYPE_STACK** map
+  *		types, the *flags* argument needs to be set to 0, but for other
+  *		map types, it may be specified as:
+  *
+  *		**BPF_F_LOCK**
+  *			Look up and delete the value of a spin-locked map
+  *			without returning the lock. This must be specified if
+  *			the elements contain a spinlock.
+  *
+  *		The **BPF_MAP_TYPE_QUEUE** and **BPF_MAP_TYPE_STACK** map types
+  *		implement this command as a "pop" operation, deleting the top
+  *		element rather than one corresponding to *key*.
+  *		The *key* and *key_len* parameters should be zeroed when
+  *		issuing this operation for these map types.
+  *
+  *		This command is only valid for the following map types:
+  *		* **BPF_MAP_TYPE_QUEUE**
+  *		* **BPF_MAP_TYPE_STACK**
+  *		* **BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH**
+  *		* **BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERCPU_HASH**
+  *		* **BPF_MAP_TYPE_LRU_HASH**
+  *		* **BPF_MAP_TYPE_LRU_PERCPU_HASH**
+  *
+  *	Return
+  *		Returns zero on success. On error, -1 is returned and *errno*
+  *		is set appropriately.
+  *
+  * BPF_MAP_FREEZE
+  *	Description
+  *		Freeze the permissions of the specified map.
+  *
+  *		Write permissions may be frozen by passing zero *flags*.
+  *		Upon success, no future syscall invocations may alter the
+  *		map state of *map_fd*. Write operations from eBPF programs
+  *		are still possible for a frozen map.
+  *
+  *		Not supported for maps of type **BPF_MAP_TYPE_STRUCT_OPS**.
+  *
+  *	Return
+  *		Returns zero on success. On error, -1 is returned and *errno*
+  *		is set appropriately.
+  *
+  * BPF_BTF_GET_NEXT_ID
+  *	Description
+  *		Fetch the next BPF Type Format (BTF) object currently loaded
+  *		into the kernel.
+  *
+  *		Looks for the BTF object with an id greater than *start_id*
+  *		and updates *next_id* on success. If no other BTF objects
+  *		remain with ids higher than *start_id*, returns -1 and sets
+  *		*errno* to **ENOENT**.
+  *
+  *	Return
+  *		Returns zero on success. On error, or when no id remains, -1
+  *		is returned and *errno* is set appropriately.
+  *
+  * BPF_MAP_LOOKUP_BATCH
+  *	Description
+  *		Iterate and fetch multiple elements in a map.
+  *
+  *		Two opaque values are used to manage batch operations,
+  *		*in_batch* and *out_batch*. Initially, *in_batch* must be set
+  *		to NULL to begin the batched operation. After each subsequent
+  *		**BPF_MAP_LOOKUP_BATCH**, the caller should pass the resultant
+  *		*out_batch* as the *in_batch* for the next operation to
+  *		continue iteration from the current point.
+  *
+  *		The *keys* and *values* are output parameters which must point
+  *		to memory large enough to hold *count* items based on the key
+  *		and value size of the map *map_fd*. The *keys* buffer must be
+  *		of *key_size* * *count*. The *values* buffer must be of
+  *		*value_size* * *count*.
+  *
+  *		The *elem_flags* argument may be specified as one of the
+  *		following:
+  *
+  *		**BPF_F_LOCK**
+  *			Look up the value of a spin-locked map without
+  *			returning the lock. This must be specified if the
+  *			elements contain a spinlock.
+  *
+  *		On success, *count* elements from the map are copied into the
+  *		user buffer, with the keys copied into *keys* and the values
+  *		copied into the corresponding indices in *values*.
+  *
+  *		If an error is returned and *errno* is not **EFAULT**, *count*
+  *		is set to the number of successfully processed elements.
+  *
+  *	Return
+  *		Returns zero on success. On error, -1 is returned and *errno*
+  *		is set appropriately.
+  *
+  *		May set *errno* to **ENOSPC** to indicate that *keys* or
+  *		*values* is too small to dump an entire bucket during
+  *		iteration of a hash-based map type.
+  *
+  * BPF_MAP_LOOKUP_AND_DELETE_BATCH
+  *	Description
+  *		Iterate and delete all elements in a map.
+  *
+  *		This operation has the same behavior as
+  *		**BPF_MAP_LOOKUP_BATCH** with two exceptions:
+  *
+  *		* Every element that is successfully returned is also deleted
+  *		  from the map. This is at least *count* elements. Note that
+  *		  *count* is both an input and an output parameter.
+  *		* Upon returning with *errno* set to **EFAULT**, up to
+  *		  *count* elements may be deleted without returning the keys
+  *		  and values of the deleted elements.
+  *
+  *	Return
+  *		Returns zero on success. On error, -1 is returned and *errno*
+  *		is set appropriately.
+  *
+  * BPF_MAP_UPDATE_BATCH
+  *	Description
+  *		Update multiple elements in a map by *key*.
+  *
+  *		The *keys* and *values* are input parameters which must point
+  *		to memory large enough to hold *count* items based on the key
+  *		and value size of the map *map_fd*. The *keys* buffer must be
+  *		of *key_size* * *count*. The *values* buffer must be of
+  *		*value_size* * *count*.
+  *
+  *		Each element specified in *keys* is sequentially updated to the
+  *		value in the corresponding index in *values*. The *in_batch*
+  *		and *out_batch* parameters are ignored and should be zeroed.
+  *
+  *		The *elem_flags* argument should be specified as one of the
+  *		following:
+  *
+  *		**BPF_ANY**
+  *			Create new elements or update a existing elements.
+  *		**BPF_NOEXIST**
+  *			Create new elements only if they do not exist.
+  *		**BPF_EXIST**
+  *			Update existing elements.
+  *		**BPF_F_LOCK**
+  *			Update spin_lock-ed map elements. This must be
+  *			specified if the map value contains a spinlock.
+  *
+  *		On success, *count* elements from the map are updated.
+  *
+  *		If an error is returned and *errno* is not **EFAULT**, *count*
+  *		is set to the number of successfully processed elements.
+  *
+  *	Return
+  *		Returns zero on success. On error, -1 is returned and *errno*
+  *		is set appropriately.
+  *
+  *		May set *errno* to **EINVAL**, **EPERM**, **ENOMEM**, or
+  *		**E2BIG**. **E2BIG** indicates that the number of elements in
+  *		the map reached the *max_entries* limit specified at map
+  *		creation time.
+  *
+  *		May set *errno* to one of the following error codes under
+  *		specific circumstances:
+  *
+  *		**EEXIST**
+  *			If *flags* specifies **BPF_NOEXIST** and the element
+  *			with *key* already exists in the map.
+  *		**ENOENT**
+  *			If *flags* specifies **BPF_EXIST** and the element with
+  *			*key* does not exist in the map.
+  *
+  * BPF_MAP_DELETE_BATCH
+  *	Description
+  *		Delete multiple elements in a map by *key*.
+  *
+  *		The *keys* parameter is an input parameter which must point
+  *		to memory large enough to hold *count* items based on the key
+  *		size of the map *map_fd*, that is, *key_size* * *count*.
+  *
+  *		Each element specified in *keys* is sequentially deleted. The
+  *		*in_batch*, *out_batch*, and *values* parameters are ignored
+  *		and should be zeroed.
+  *
+  *		The *elem_flags* argument may be specified as one of the
+  *		following:
+  *
+  *		**BPF_F_LOCK**
+  *			Look up the value of a spin-locked map without
+  *			returning the lock. This must be specified if the
+  *			elements contain a spinlock.
+  *
+  *		On success, *count* elements from the map are updated.
+  *
+  *		If an error is returned and *errno* is not **EFAULT**, *count*
+  *		is set to the number of successfully processed elements. If
+  *		*errno* is **EFAULT**, up to *count* elements may be been
+  *		deleted.
+  *
+  *	Return
+  *		Returns zero on success. On error, -1 is returned and *errno*
+  *		is set appropriately.
+  *
+  * BPF_LINK_CREATE
+  *	Description
+  *		Attach an eBPF program to a *target_fd* at the specified
+  *		*attach_type* hook and return a file descriptor handle for
+  *		managing the link.
+  *
+  *	Return
+  *		A new file descriptor (a nonnegative integer), or -1 if an
+  *		error occurred (in which case, *errno* is set appropriately).
+  *
+  * BPF_LINK_UPDATE
+  *	Description
+  *		Update the eBPF program in the specified *link_fd* to
+  *		*new_prog_fd*.
+  *
+  *	Return
+  *		Returns zero on success. On error, -1 is returned and *errno*
+  *		is set appropriately.
+  *
+  * BPF_LINK_GET_FD_BY_ID
+  *	Description
+  *		Open a file descriptor for the eBPF Link corresponding to
+  *		*link_id*.
+  *
+  *	Return
+  *		A new file descriptor (a nonnegative integer), or -1 if an
+  *		error occurred (in which case, *errno* is set appropriately).
+  *
+  * BPF_LINK_GET_NEXT_ID
+  *	Description
+  *		Fetch the next eBPF link currently loaded into the kernel.
+  *
+  *		Looks for the eBPF link with an id greater than *start_id*
+  *		and updates *next_id* on success. If no other eBPF links
+  *		remain with ids higher than *start_id*, returns -1 and sets
+  *		*errno* to **ENOENT**.
+  *
+  *	Return
+  *		Returns zero on success. On error, or when no id remains, -1
+  *		is returned and *errno* is set appropriately.
+  *
+  * BPF_ENABLE_STATS
+  *	Description
+  *		Enable eBPF runtime statistics gathering.
+  *
+  *		Runtime statistics gathering for the eBPF runtime is disabled
+  *		by default to minimize the corresponding performance overhead.
+  *		This command enables statistics globally.
+  *
+  *		Multiple programs may independently enable statistics.
+  *		After gathering the desired statistics, eBPF runtime statistics
+  *		may be disabled again by calling **close**\ (2) for the file
+  *		descriptor returned by this function. Statistics will only be
+  *		disabled system-wide when all outstanding file descriptors
+  *		returned by prior calls for this subcommand are closed.
+  *
+  *	Return
+  *		A new file descriptor (a nonnegative integer), or -1 if an
+  *		error occurred (in which case, *errno* is set appropriately).
+  *
+  * BPF_ITER_CREATE
+  *	Description
+  *		Create an iterator on top of the specified *link_fd* (as
+  *		previously created using **BPF_LINK_CREATE**) and return a
+  *		file descriptor that can be used to trigger the iteration.
+  *
+  *		If the resulting file descriptor is pinned to the filesystem
+  *		using  **BPF_OBJ_PIN**, then subsequent **read**\ (2) syscalls
+  *		for that path will trigger the iterator to read kernel state
+  *		using the eBPF program attached to *link_fd*.
+  *
+  *	Return
+  *		A new file descriptor (a nonnegative integer), or -1 if an
+  *		error occurred (in which case, *errno* is set appropriately).
+  *
+  * BPF_LINK_DETACH
+  *	Description
+  *		Forcefully detach the specified *link_fd* from its
+  *		corresponding attachment point.
+  *
+  *	Return
+  *		Returns zero on success. On error, -1 is returned and *errno*
+  *		is set appropriately.
+  *
+  * BPF_PROG_BIND_MAP
+  *	Description
+  *		Bind a map to the lifetime of an eBPF program.
+  *
+  *		The map identified by *map_fd* is bound to the program
+  *		identified by *prog_fd* and only released when *prog_fd* is
+  *		released. This may be used in cases where metadata should be
+  *		associated with a program which otherwise does not contain any
+  *		references to the map (for example, embedded in the eBPF
+  *		program instructions).
+  *
+  *	Return
+  *		Returns zero on success. On error, -1 is returned and *errno*
+  *		is set appropriately.
+  *
+  * NOTES
+  *	eBPF objects (maps and programs) can be shared between processes.
+  *
+  *	* After **fork**\ (2), the child inherits file descriptors
+  *	  referring to the same eBPF objects.
+  *	* File descriptors referring to eBPF objects can be transferred over
+  *	  **unix**\ (7) domain sockets.
+  *	* File descriptors referring to eBPF objects can be duplicated in the
+  *	  usual way, using **dup**\ (2) and similar calls.
+  *	* File descriptors referring to eBPF objects can be pinned to the
+  *	  filesystem using the **BPF_OBJ_PIN** command of **bpf**\ (2).
+  *
+  *	An eBPF object is deallocated only after all file descriptors referring
+  *	to the object have been closed and no references remain pinned to the
+  *	filesystem or attached (for example, bound to a program or device).
