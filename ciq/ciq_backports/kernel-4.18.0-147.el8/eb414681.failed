Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/eb414681.failed

When systems are overcommitted and resources become contended, it's hard
to tell exactly the impact this has on workload productivity, or how close
the system is to lockups and OOM kills.  In particular, when machines work
multiple jobs concurrently, the impact of overcommit in terms of latency
and throughput on the individual job can be enormous.

In order to maximize hardware utilization without sacrificing individual
job health or risk complete machine lockups, this patch implements a way
to quantify resource pressure in the system.

A kernel built with CONFIG_PSI=y creates files in /proc/pressure/ that
expose the percentage of time the system is stalled on CPU, memory, or IO,
respectively.  Stall states are aggregate versions of the per-task delay
accounting delays:

       cpu: some tasks are runnable but not executing on a CPU
       memory: tasks are reclaiming, or waiting for swapin or thrashing cache
       io: tasks are waiting for io completions

These percentages of walltime can be thought of as pressure percentages,
and they give a general sense of system health and productivity loss
incurred by resource overcommit.  They can also indicate when the system
is approaching lockup scenarios and OOMs.

To do this, psi keeps track of the task states associated with each CPU
and samples the time they spend in stall states.  Every 2 seconds, the
samples are averaged across CPUs - weighted by the CPUs' non-idle time to
eliminate artifacts from unused CPUs - and translated into percentages of
walltime.  A running average of those percentages is maintained over 10s,
1m, and 5m periods (similar to the loadaverage).

+================================
+PSI - Pressure Stall Information
+================================
+
+:Date: April, 2018
+:Author: Johannes Weiner <hannes@cmpxchg.org>
+
+When CPU, memory or IO devices are contended, workloads experience
+latency spikes, throughput losses, and run the risk of OOM kills.
+
+Without an accurate measure of such contention, users are forced to
+either play it safe and under-utilize their hardware resources, or
+roll the dice and frequently suffer the disruptions resulting from
+excessive overcommit.
+
+The psi feature identifies and quantifies the disruptions caused by
+such resource crunches and the time impact it has on complex workloads
+or even entire systems.
+
+Having an accurate measure of productivity losses caused by resource
+scarcity aids users in sizing workloads to hardware--or provisioning
+hardware according to workload demand.
+
+As psi aggregates this information in realtime, systems can be managed
+dynamically using techniques such as load shedding, migrating jobs to
+other systems or data centers, or strategically pausing or killing low
+priority or restartable batch jobs.
+
+This allows maximizing hardware utilization without sacrificing
+workload health or risking major disruptions such as OOM kills.
+
+Pressure interface
+==================
+
+Pressure information for each resource is exported through the
+respective file in /proc/pressure/ -- cpu, memory, and io.
+
+The format for CPU is as such:
+
+some avg10=0.00 avg60=0.00 avg300=0.00 total=0
+
+and for memory and IO:
+
+some avg10=0.00 avg60=0.00 avg300=0.00 total=0
+full avg10=0.00 avg60=0.00 avg300=0.00 total=0
+
+The "some" line indicates the share of time in which at least some
+tasks are stalled on a given resource.
+
+The "full" line indicates the share of time in which all non-idle
+tasks are stalled on a given resource simultaneously. In this state
+actual CPU cycles are going to waste, and a workload that spends
+extended time in this state is considered to be thrashing. This has
+severe impact on performance, and it's useful to distinguish this
+situation from a state where some tasks are stalled but the CPU is
+still doing productive work. As such, time spent in this subset of the
+stall state is tracked separately and exported in the "full" averages.
+
+The ratios are tracked as recent trends over ten, sixty, and three
+hundred second windows, which gives insight into short term events as
+well as medium and long term trends. The total absolute stall time is
+tracked and exported as well, to allow detection of latency spikes
+which wouldn't necessarily make a dent in the time averages, or to
+average trends over custom time frames.

+ * Pressure stall information for CPU, memory and IO

+ * Author: Johannes Weiner <hannes@cmpxchg.org>
+ *
+ * When CPU, memory and IO are contended, tasks experience delays that
+ * reduce throughput and introduce latencies into the workload. Memory
+ * and IO contention, in addition, can cause a full loss of forward
+ * progress in which the CPU goes idle.
+ *
+ * This code aggregates individual task delays into resource pressure
+ * metrics that indicate problems with both workload health and
+ * resource utilization.
+ *
+ *			Model
+ *
+ * The time in which a task can execute on a CPU is our baseline for
+ * productivity. Pressure expresses the amount of time in which this
+ * potential cannot be realized due to resource contention.
+ *
+ * This concept of productivity has two components: the workload and
+ * the CPU. To measure the impact of pressure on both, we define two
+ * contention states for a resource: SOME and FULL.
+ *
+ * In the SOME state of a given resource, one or more tasks are
+ * delayed on that resource. This affects the workload's ability to
+ * perform work, but the CPU may still be executing other tasks.
+ *
+ * In the FULL state of a given resource, all non-idle tasks are
+ * delayed on that resource such that nobody is advancing and the CPU
+ * goes idle. This leaves both workload and CPU unproductive.
+ *
+ * (Naturally, the FULL state doesn't exist for the CPU resource.)
+ *
+ *	SOME = nr_delayed_tasks != 0
+ *	FULL = nr_delayed_tasks != 0 && nr_running_tasks == 0
+ *
+ * The percentage of wallclock time spent in those compound stall
+ * states gives pressure numbers between 0 and 100 for each resource,
+ * where the SOME percentage indicates workload slowdowns and the FULL
+ * percentage indicates reduced CPU utilization:
+ *
+ *	%SOME = time(SOME) / period
+ *	%FULL = time(FULL) / period
+ *
+ *			Multiple CPUs
+ *
+ * The more tasks and available CPUs there are, the more work can be
+ * performed concurrently. This means that the potential that can go
+ * unrealized due to resource contention *also* scales with non-idle
+ * tasks and CPUs.
+ *
+ * Consider a scenario where 257 number crunching tasks are trying to
+ * run concurrently on 256 CPUs. If we simply aggregated the task
+ * states, we would have to conclude a CPU SOME pressure number of
+ * 100%, since *somebody* is waiting on a runqueue at all
+ * times. However, that is clearly not the amount of contention the
+ * workload is experiencing: only one out of 256 possible exceution
+ * threads will be contended at any given time, or about 0.4%.
+ *
+ * Conversely, consider a scenario of 4 tasks and 4 CPUs where at any
+ * given time *one* of the tasks is delayed due to a lack of memory.
+ * Again, looking purely at the task state would yield a memory FULL
+ * pressure number of 0%, since *somebody* is always making forward
+ * progress. But again this wouldn't capture the amount of execution
+ * potential lost, which is 1 out of 4 CPUs, or 25%.
+ *
+ * To calculate wasted potential (pressure) with multiple processors,
+ * we have to base our calculation on the number of non-idle tasks in
+ * conjunction with the number of available CPUs, which is the number
+ * of potential execution threads. SOME becomes then the proportion of
+ * delayed tasks to possibe threads, and FULL is the share of possible
+ * threads that are unproductive due to delays:
+ *
+ *	threads = min(nr_nonidle_tasks, nr_cpus)
+ *	   SOME = min(nr_delayed_tasks / threads, 1)
+ *	   FULL = (threads - min(nr_running_tasks, threads)) / threads
+ *
+ * For the 257 number crunchers on 256 CPUs, this yields:
+ *
+ *	threads = min(257, 256)
+ *	   SOME = min(1 / 256, 1)             = 0.4%
+ *	   FULL = (256 - min(257, 256)) / 256 = 0%
+ *
+ * For the 1 out of 4 memory-delayed tasks, this yields:
+ *
+ *	threads = min(4, 4)
+ *	   SOME = min(1 / 4, 1)               = 25%
+ *	   FULL = (4 - min(3, 4)) / 4         = 25%
+ *
+ * [ Substitute nr_cpus with 1, and you can see that it's a natural
+ *   extension of the single-CPU model. ]
+ *
+ *			Implementation
+ *
+ * To assess the precise time spent in each such state, we would have
+ * to freeze the system on task changes and start/stop the state
+ * clocks accordingly. Obviously that doesn't scale in practice.
+ *
+ * Because the scheduler aims to distribute the compute load evenly
+ * among the available CPUs, we can track task state locally to each
+ * CPU and, at much lower frequency, extrapolate the global state for
+ * the cumulative stall times and the running averages.
+ *
+ * For each runqueue, we track:
+ *
+ *	   tSOME[cpu] = time(nr_delayed_tasks[cpu] != 0)
+ *	   tFULL[cpu] = time(nr_delayed_tasks[cpu] && !nr_running_tasks[cpu])
+ *	tNONIDLE[cpu] = time(nr_nonidle_tasks[cpu] != 0)
+ *
+ * and then periodically aggregate:
+ *
+ *	tNONIDLE = sum(tNONIDLE[i])
+ *
+ *	   tSOME = sum(tSOME[i] * tNONIDLE[i]) / tNONIDLE
+ *	   tFULL = sum(tFULL[i] * tNONIDLE[i]) / tNONIDLE
+ *
+ *	   %SOME = tSOME / period
+ *	   %FULL = tFULL / period
+ *
+ * This gives us an approximation of pressure that is practical
+ * cost-wise, yet way more sensitive and accurate than periodic
+ * sampling of the aggregate task states would be.
