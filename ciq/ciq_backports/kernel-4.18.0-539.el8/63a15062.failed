Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-539.el8/63a15062.failed

With the introduction of allocation timestamps being included in
page_owner output, each record becomes unique due to the timestamp
nanosecond granularity.  Remove the check in add_list that tries to
collate each record during processing as the memcmp() is just additional
overhead at this point.

Also keep the allocation timestamps, but allow collation to occur without
consideration of the allocation timestamp except in the case were
allocation timestamps are requested by the user (the -a option).
