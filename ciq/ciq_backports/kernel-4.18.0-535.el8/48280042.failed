"XSAVE consistency problem" has been reported under Xen, but that's the extent
of my divination skills.

Modify XSTATE_WARN_ON() to force the caller to provide relevant diagnostic
information, and modify each caller suitably.

For check_xstate_against_struct(), this removes a double WARN() where one will
do perfectly fine.

CC stable as this has been wonky debugging for 7 years and it is good to
have there too.
