commit 929be906fa83151c4c77c07cd3d780439d38b153
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-rt-4.18.0-553.16.1.rt7.357.el8_10/929be906.failed

Add SPDX license identifier and replace license boilerplate.
Corrects various checkpatch errors with the older format for
noting the LGPL license.
