Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-511.el8/1c3d69ab.failed

Smatch complains that "rc" can be uninitialized if we hit the "break;"
statement on the first iteration through the loop.  I suspect that this
can't happen in real life, but returning a zero literal is cleaner and
silence the static checker warning.
