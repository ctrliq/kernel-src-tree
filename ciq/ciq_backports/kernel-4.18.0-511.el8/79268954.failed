Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-511.el8/79268954.failed

Since this is a modern-only device,
tag config space fields as having little endian-ness.

TODO: check other uses of __virtioXX types in this header,
should probably be __leXX.
