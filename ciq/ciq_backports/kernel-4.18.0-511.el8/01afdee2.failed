Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-511.el8/01afdee2.failed

Let's use wrappers for the low-level functions that dev_dbg/dev_warn
and work on addr + size, such that we can reuse them for adding/removing
in other granularity.

We only warn when adding memory failed, because that's something to pay
attention to. We won't warn when removing failed, we'll reuse that in
racy context soon (and we do have proper BUG_ON() statements in the
current cases where it must never happen).
