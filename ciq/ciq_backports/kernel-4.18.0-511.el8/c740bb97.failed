Until now, memory provided by a single virtio-mem device was usually
either onlined completely to ZONE_MOVABLE (online_movable) or to
ZONE_NORMAL (online_kernel); however, that will change in the future.

There are two reasons why we want to track to which zone a memory blocks
belongs to and prioritize ZONE_MOVABLE blocks:

1) Memory managed by ZONE_MOVABLE can more likely get unplugged, therefore,
   resulting in a faster memory hotunplug process. Further, we can more
   reliably unplug and remove complete memory blocks, removing metadata
   allocated for the whole memory block.

2) We want to avoid corner cases where unplugging with the current scheme
   (highest to lowest address) could result in accidential zone imbalances,
   whereby we remove too much ZONE_NORMAL memory for ZONE_MOVABLE memory
   of the same device.

Let's track the zone via memory block states and try unplug from
ZONE_MOVABLE first. Rename VIRTIO_MEM_SBM_MB_ONLINE* to
VIRTIO_MEM_SBM_MB_KERNEL* to avoid even longer state names.

In commit 27f852795a06 ("virtio-mem: don't special-case ZONE_MOVABLE"),
we removed slightly similar tracking for fully plugged memory blocks to
support unplugging from ZONE_MOVABLE at all -- as we didn't allow partially
plugged memory blocks in ZONE_MOVABLE before that. That commit already
mentioned "In the future, we might want to remember the zone again and use
the information when (un)plugging memory."
