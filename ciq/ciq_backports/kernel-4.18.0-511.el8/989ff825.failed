Let's check by traversing busy system RAM resources instead, to avoid
relying on memory block states.

Don't use walk_system_ram_range(), as that works on pages and we want to
use the bare addresses we have easily at hand.

This is a preparation for Big Block Mode (BBM), which won't have memory
block states.
