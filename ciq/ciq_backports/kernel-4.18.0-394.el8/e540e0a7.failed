Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-394.el8/e540e0a7.failed

Functions that are only called by assembly don't always have a
C header file prototype.

Add the prototypes before moving the assembly callers to C.
