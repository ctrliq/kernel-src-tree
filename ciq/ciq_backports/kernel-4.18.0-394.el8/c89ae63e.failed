In dbgfs "schemes" interface, i do some test like this:
    # cd /sys/kernel/debug/damon
    # echo "2 1 2 1 10 1 3 10 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 3" > schemes
    # cat schemes
    # 2 1 2 1 10 1 3 10 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 3 0 0

There have some unreasonable places, i set the valules of these variables
"<min_sz, max_sz> <min_nr_a, max_nr_a>, <min_age, max_age>, <wmarks.high,
wmarks.mid, wmarks.low>" as "<2, 1>, <2, 1>, <10, 1>, <1, 2, 3>.

So there add a validity judgment for these thresholds value.
