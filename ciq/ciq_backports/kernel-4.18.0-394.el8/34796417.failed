DAMON debugfs interface iterates current monitoring targets in
'dbgfs_target_ids_read()' while holding the corresponding
'kdamond_lock'.  However, it also destructs the monitoring targets in
'dbgfs_before_terminate()' without holding the lock.  This can result in
a use_after_free bug.  This commit avoids the race by protecting the
destruction with the corresponding 'kdamond_lock'.
