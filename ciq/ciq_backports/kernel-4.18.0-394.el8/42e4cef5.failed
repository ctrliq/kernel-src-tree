Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-394.el8/42e4cef5.failed

Just get the pid by 'current->pid'.  Meanwhile, to be symmetrical make
the 'starts' and 'finishes' logs both use debug level.
