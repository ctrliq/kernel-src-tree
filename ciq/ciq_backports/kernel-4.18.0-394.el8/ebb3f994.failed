DAMON debugfs interface increases the reference counts of 'struct pid's
for targets from the 'target_ids' file write callback
('dbgfs_target_ids_write()'), but decreases the counts only in DAMON
monitoring termination callback ('dbgfs_before_terminate()').

Therefore, when 'target_ids' file is repeatedly written without DAMON
monitoring start/termination, the reference count is not decreased and
therefore memory for the 'struct pid' cannot be freed.  This commit
fixes this issue by decreasing the reference counts when 'target_ids' is
written.
