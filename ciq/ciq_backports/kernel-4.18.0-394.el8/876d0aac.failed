Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-394.el8/876d0aac.failed

Building DAMON documents warns for a reference to nonexisting doc, as
below:

    $ time make htmldocs
    [...]
    Documentation/vm/damon/index.rst:24: WARNING: toctree contains reference to nonexisting document 'vm/damon/plans'

This fixes the warning by removing the wrong reference.
