If the time/space quotas of a given DAMON-based operation scheme is too
small, the scheme could show unexpectedly slow progress.  However, there
is no good way to notice the case in runtime.  This commit extends the
DAMOS stat to provide how many times the quota limits exceeded so that
the users can easily notice the case and tune the scheme.
