Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-394.el8/e56360d6.failed

regmap_mdio_read() breaks the principle of "no touch output till it's known
that the operation succeeds". Refactor it accordingly.
