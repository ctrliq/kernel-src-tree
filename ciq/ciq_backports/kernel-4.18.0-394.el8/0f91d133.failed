Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-394.el8/0f91d133.failed

A kernel thread can exit gracefully with kthread_stop().  So we don't
need a new flag 'kdamond_stop'.  And to make sure the task struct is not
freed when accessing it, get reference to it before termination.
