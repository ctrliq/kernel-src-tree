Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-394.el8/6fa7e0e8.failed

The command should be submitted only if the engine is idle,
for this, the next available descriptor is checked and set the flag
to false in case the descriptor is non-empty.
