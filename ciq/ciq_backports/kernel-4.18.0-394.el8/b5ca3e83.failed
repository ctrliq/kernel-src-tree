When the ctx->adaptive_targets list is empty, I did some test on
monitor_on interface like this.

    # cat /sys/kernel/debug/damon/target_ids
    #
    # echo on > /sys/kernel/debug/damon/monitor_on
    # damon: kdamond (5390) starts

Though the ctx->adaptive_targets list is empty, but the kthread_run
still be called, and the kdamond.x thread still be created, this is
meaningless.

So there adds a judgment in 'dbgfs_monitor_on_write', if the
ctx->adaptive_targets list is empty, return -EINVAL.
