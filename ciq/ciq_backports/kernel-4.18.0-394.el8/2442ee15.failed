Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-394.el8/2442ee15.failed

The pitfalls of regression testing on a machine without realising
that selinux was disabled. Only set the attr fork during inode
allocation if the attr feature bits are already set on the
superblock.
