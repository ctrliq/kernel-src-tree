Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-394.el8/9210622a.failed

In some functions, it's unnecessary to declare 'err' and 'ret' variables
at the same time.  This patch mainly to simplify the issue of such
declarations by reusing one variable.
