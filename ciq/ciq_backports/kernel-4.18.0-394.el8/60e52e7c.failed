Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-394.el8/60e52e7c.failed

This implements new DAMON_RECLAIM parameters for statistics reporting.
Those can be used for understanding how DAMON_RECLAIM is working, and
for tuning the other parameters.
