Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-394.el8/199b50f4.failed

The only usage of these structs is to pass their addresses to
walk_page_range(), which takes a pointer to const mm_walk_ops as
argument.  Make them const to allow the compiler to put them in
read-only memory.
