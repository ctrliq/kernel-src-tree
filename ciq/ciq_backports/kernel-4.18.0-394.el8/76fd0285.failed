DAMON's virtual address spaces monitoring primitive uses 'struct pid *'
of the target process as its monitoring target id.  The kernel address
is exposed as-is to the user space via the DAMON tracepoint,
'damon_aggregated'.

Though primarily only privileged users are allowed to access that, it
would be better to avoid unnecessarily exposing kernel pointers so.
Because the trace result is only required to be able to distinguish each
target, we aren't need to use the pointer as-is.

This makes the tracepoint to use the index of the target in the
context's targets list as its id in the tracepoint, to hide the kernel
space address.
