DAMON-based operation schemes need to be manually turned on and off.  In
some use cases, however, the condition for turning a scheme on and off
would depend on the system's situation.  For example, schemes for
proactive pages reclamation would need to be turned on when some memory
pressure is detected, and turned off when the system has enough free
memory.

For easier control of schemes activation based on the system situation,
this introduces a watermarks-based mechanism.  The client can describe
the watermark metric (e.g., amount of free memory in the system),
watermark check interval, and three watermarks, namely high, mid, and
low.  If the scheme is deactivated, it only gets the metric and compare
that to the three watermarks for every check interval.  If the metric is
higher than the high watermark, the scheme is deactivated.  If the
metric is between the mid watermark and the low watermark, the scheme is
activated.  If the metric is lower than the low watermark, the scheme is
deactivated again.  This is to allow users fall back to traditional
page-granularity mechanisms.
