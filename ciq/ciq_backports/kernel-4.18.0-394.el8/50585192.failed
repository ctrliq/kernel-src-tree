Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-394.el8/50585192.failed

If DAMOS has stopped applying action in the middle of a group of memory
regions due to its size quota, it starts the work again from the
beginning of the address space in the next charge window.  If there is a
huge memory region at the beginning of the address space and it fulfills
the scheme's target data access pattern always, the action will applied
to only the region.

This mitigates the case by skipping memory regions that charged in
current charge window at the beginning of next charge window.
