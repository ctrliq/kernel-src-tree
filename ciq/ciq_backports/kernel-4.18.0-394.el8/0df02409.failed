Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-394.el8/0df02409.failed

When an invalid register offset is provided, the upper bits are silently
discarded. Change this to return -ENXIO instead, to help catch potential
bugs.
