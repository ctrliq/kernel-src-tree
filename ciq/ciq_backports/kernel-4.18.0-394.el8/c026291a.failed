This makes the 'damon-dbgfs' to support the physical memory monitoring,
in addition to the virtual memory monitoring.

Users can do the physical memory monitoring by writing a special
keyword, 'paddr' to the 'target_ids' debugfs file.  Then, DAMON will
check the special keyword and configure the monitoring context to run
with the primitives for the physical address space.

Unlike the virtual memory monitoring, the monitoring target region will
not be automatically set.  Therefore, users should also set the
monitoring target address region using the 'init_regions' debugfs file.

Also, note that the physical memory monitoring will not automatically
terminated.  The user should explicitly turn off the monitoring by
writing 'off' to the 'monitor_on' debugfs file.
