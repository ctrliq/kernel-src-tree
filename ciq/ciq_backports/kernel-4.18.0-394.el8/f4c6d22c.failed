commit f4c6d22c6cf282ef7d24a724b9bd978ee2b74fc6
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-394.el8/f4c6d22c.failed

Due to a mistake in patches reordering, a comment for a future feature
called 'arbitrary monitoring target support'[1], which is still under
development, has added.  Because it only introduces confusion and we
don't have a plan to post the patches soon, this commit removes the
mistakenly added part.
