DAMON core prints error messages when damon_target object creation is
failed or wrong monitoring attributes are given.  Because appropriate
error code is returned for each case, the messages are not essential.
Also, because the code path can be triggered with user-specified input,
this could result in kernel log mistakenly being messy.  To avoid the
case, this commit removes the messages.
