Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-394.el8/b6ccf019.failed

There is a need to segregate the cases when DMA is complete or not.
In case if DMA is already complete there is no need to handle it
again and gracefully exit from the function.
