Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-394.el8/251403f1.failed

Failure of 'damon_va_three_regions()' is logged using 'pr_err()'.  But,
the function can fail in legal situations.  To avoid making users be
surprised and to keep the kernel clean, this makes the log to be printed
using 'pr_debug()'.
