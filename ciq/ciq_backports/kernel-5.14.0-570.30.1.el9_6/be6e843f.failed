When migrating a THP, concurrent access to the PMD migration entry during
a deferred split scan can lead to an invalid address access, as
illustrated below.  To prevent this invalid access, it is necessary to
check the PMD migration entry and return early.  In this context, there is
no need to use pmd_to_swp_entry and pfn_swap_entry_to_page to verify the
equality of the target folio.  Since the PMD migration entry is locked, it
cannot be served as the target.

Mailing list discussion and explanation from Hugh Dickins: "An anon_vma
lookup points to a location which may contain the folio of interest, but
might instead contain another folio: and weeding out those other folios is
precisely what the "folio != pmd_folio((*pmd)" check (and the "risk of
replacing the wrong folio" comment a few lines above it) is for."
