Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

The Python finished() helper currently exits with KSFT_FAIL when there
are only passed and skipped tests. Fix the logic to exit with KSFT_PASS
instead, making it consistent with its C and bash counterparts
(ksft_finished() and ktap_finished() respectively).
