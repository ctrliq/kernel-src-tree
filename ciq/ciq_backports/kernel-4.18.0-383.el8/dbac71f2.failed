Setting the skb packet type field to host is usually
done when performing forwarding to ingress device.

This is required since the receive handling that is used
by the redirect to ingress action checks whether the packet
doesn't belong to this host and drops the packet in such case.

In order to be able to offload action redirect ingress, tc offload
code needs to accept the skbedit ptype action as well.

There's no special handling in HW for such action since it will
be followed by a redirect action and therefore, this code
only allows us to accept such action in the actions list but
not performing anything specific in HW for it.
