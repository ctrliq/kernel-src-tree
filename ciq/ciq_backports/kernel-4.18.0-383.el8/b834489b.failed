Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-383.el8/b834489b.failed

Add a flag and helper function to indicate that a PHY device is part of
an SFP module, which is set on attach. This can be used by PHY drivers
to handle SFP-specific quirks or behavior.
