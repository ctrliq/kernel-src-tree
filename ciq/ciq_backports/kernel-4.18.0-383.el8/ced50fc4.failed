Removing unused cnt increase from EMIT macro together with cnt declarations.
This was introduced in commit [1] to ensure proper code generation. But that
code was removed in commit [2] and this extra code was left in.

  [1] b52f00e6a715 ("x86: bpf_jit: implement bpf_tail_call() helper")
  [2] ebf7d1f508a7 ("bpf, x64: rework pro/epilogue and tailcall handling in JIT")
