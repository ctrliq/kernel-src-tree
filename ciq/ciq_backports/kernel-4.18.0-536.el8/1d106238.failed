Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-536.el8/1d106238.failed

The driver makes extensive use of both ACPI link and ASoC DAI link
structs, often referring to both with the variable name link. Make the
code a little easier to follow by consistently using adr_link for the
ACPI bits and dai_links for the ASoC bits.
