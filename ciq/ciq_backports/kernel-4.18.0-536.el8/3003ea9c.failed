commit 3003ea9cb7bd6399ca9962e0b3dd0ac58b151c2e
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-536.el8/3003ea9c.failed

get_dailink_info already checked if the adr_link pointer was NULL so
there is no need to recheck later in sof_card_dai_links_create.
