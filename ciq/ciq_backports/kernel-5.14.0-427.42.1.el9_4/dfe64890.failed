Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-5.14.0-427.42.1.el9_4/dfe64890.failed

Fix up some inaccuracies in the BHI documentation.

  Full mitigation might require a microcode update from the CPU
  vendor. When the necessary microcode is not available, the kernel will
  report vulnerability.
