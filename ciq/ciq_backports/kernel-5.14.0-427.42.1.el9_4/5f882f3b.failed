commit 5f882f3b0a8bf0788d5a0ee44b1191de5319bb8a
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-5.14.0-427.42.1.el9_4/5f882f3b.failed

While syscall hardening helps prevent some BHI attacks, there's still
other low-hanging fruit remaining.  Don't classify it as a mitigation
and make it clear that the system may still be vulnerable if it doesn't
have a HW or SW mitigation enabled.

  Full mitigation might require a microcode update from the CPU
  vendor. When the necessary microcode is not available, the kernel will
  report vulnerability.
