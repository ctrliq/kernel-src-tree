When trust is turned off for the VF, the expectation is that promiscuous
and allmulticast filters are removed. Currently default VSI filter is not
getting cleared in this flow.

Example:

ip link set enp236s0f0 vf 0 trust on
ip link set enp236s0f0v0 promisc on
ip link set enp236s0f0 vf 0 trust off
/* promiscuous mode is still enabled on VF0 */

Remove switch filters for both cases.
This commit fixes above behavior by removing default VSI filters and
allmulticast filters when vf-true-promisc-support is OFF.
