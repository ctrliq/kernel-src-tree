There is a mix of drivers using either 'depends on HID' or 'select HID',
which causes both circular dependencies and missed dependencies for
a 'select':

Avoid this by changing all HID client drivers to use 'depends on HID'.
For I2C_HID, this requires a larger rework of the Kconfig description,
but it hopefully becomes easier to understand without the complex
I2C_HID_CORE definition.
