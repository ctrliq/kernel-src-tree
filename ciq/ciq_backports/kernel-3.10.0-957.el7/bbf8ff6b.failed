commit bbf8ff6b1d2ae749d962fd9ff743164fe13abf5d
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/bbf8ff6b.failed

Added a new helper file for these fixups due to requiring a huge number
of coefs being set to get the top speakers to work, as well as
setting pin 0x17 for the top speakers and the correct input source
of 0x17 for volume control

[ Note: this is a revised work based on Tom's fixup patch with the
  replacement of the full COEF tables provided by Realtek.
  Also, the fixup function has a proper HDA_FIXUP_ACT_* handling now.
  The credit for the new COEF table goes to Kailang  -- tiwai ]
