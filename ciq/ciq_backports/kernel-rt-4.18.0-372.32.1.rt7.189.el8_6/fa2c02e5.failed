Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-rt-4.18.0-372.32.1.rt7.189.el8_6/fa2c02e5.failed

The linux/kconfig.h file was copied from the kernel but the line where
with the generated/autoconf.h include from where the CONFIG_ entries
would come from was deleted, as tools/ build system don't create that
file, so we ended up always defining just __LITTLE_ENDIAN as
CONFIG_CPU_BIG_ENDIAN was nowhere to be found.

This in turn ended up breaking the build in some systems where
__LITTLE_ENDIAN was already defined, such as the androind NDK.

So just ditch that block that depends on the CONFIG_CPU_BIG_ENDIAN
define.

The kconfig.h file was copied just to get IS_ENABLED() and a
'make -C tools/all' doesn't breaks with this removal.
