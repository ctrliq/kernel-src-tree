Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-5.14.0-570.23.1.el9_6/c692696f.failed

For the purpose of setting old non-pad based sub-device try format as a
basis for VIDIOC_TRY_FMT implementation, there is no need to set the
format in the sub-device state. Drop the assignment to the state, which
would result in a NULL pointer dereference.
