Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-486.el8/faabfcb1.failed

The SMM_CTL MSR not present feature was being open-coded for KVM.
Add it to its newly added CPUID leaf 0x80000021 EAX proper.

Also drop the bit description comments now the code is more
self-describing.
