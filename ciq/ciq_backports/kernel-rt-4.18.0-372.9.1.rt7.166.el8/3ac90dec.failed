Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-rt-4.18.0-372.9.1.rt7.166.el8/3ac90dec.failed

The channels array in struct mlx5e_rx_res is converted to a dynamic one,
which will use the dynamic value of max_nch instead of
implementation-defined maximum of MLX5E_MAX_NUM_CHANNELS.
