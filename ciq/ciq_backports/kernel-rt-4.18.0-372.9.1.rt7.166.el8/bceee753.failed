Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-rt-4.18.0-372.9.1.rt7.166.el8/bceee753.failed

When a playback stream runs in the implicit feedback mode, its
operation is passive and won't start unless the capture packet is
received.  This behavior contradicts with the low-latency playback
mode, and we should turn off lowlatency_playback flag accordingly.

In theory, we may take the low-latency mode when the playback-first
quirk is set, but it still conflicts with the later operation with the
fixed packet numbers, so it's disabled all together for now.
