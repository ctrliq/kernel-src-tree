Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-rt-4.18.0-372.9.1.rt7.166.el8/68511b48.failed

Remove redundant and trivial error logging when trying to
offload mirred device with unsupported devices.
Using OVS could hit those a lot and the errors are still
logged in extack.
