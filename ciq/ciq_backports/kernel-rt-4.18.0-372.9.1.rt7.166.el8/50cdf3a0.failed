commit 50cdf3a0961fd0d0bcb71b85eeccb3a9783bf1b6
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-rt-4.18.0-372.9.1.rt7.166.el8/50cdf3a0.failed

Clean up the driver with the new managed buffer allocation API.
The hw_params and hw_free callbacks became superfluous and got
dropped.
