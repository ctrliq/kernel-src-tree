Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-rt-4.18.0-372.9.1.rt7.166.el8/53451b6d.failed

The recent support for the improved low-latency playback mode applied
the SNDRV_PCM_INFO_EXPLICIT_SYNC flag for the target streams, but this
was a slight overkill.  The use of the flag above disables effectively
both PCM status and control mmaps, while basically what we want to
track is only about the appl_ptr update.

For less restriction, use a more proper flag,
SNDRV_PCM_INFO_SYNC_APPLPTR instead, which disables only the control
mmap.
