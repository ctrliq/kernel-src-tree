Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-rt-4.18.0-372.9.1.rt7.166.el8/b2ebcf42.failed

Free widgets for static pipelines in sof_tear_down_pipelines().
But this feature is unavailable in older firmware with ABI < 3.19.
Just reset widget use_count's for this case. This would ensure that
the secondary cores enabled required for topology setup are powered
down properly before the primary core is powered off during
system suspend.
