Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-rt-4.18.0-372.9.1.rt7.166.el8/707f0c29.failed

Since the "Add special handling for timer based S0i3 wakeup" changes
the amd-pmc code now relies on symbols from the RTC-class code,
add a dependency for this to Kconfig.
