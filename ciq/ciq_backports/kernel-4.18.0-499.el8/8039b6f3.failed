Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-499.el8/8039b6f3.failed

By default autoenumeration is enabled on QCom SoundWire controller
which means the core should not be dealing with device 0 w.r.t enumeration.

During Enumeration if SoundWire core sees status[0] as SDW_SLAVE_ATTACHED and
start programming the device id, however reading DEVID registers return zeros
which does not match to any of the slaves in the list and the core attempts
to park this device to Group 13.  This results in adding SoundWire device
with enumeration address 0:0:0:0

Fix this by not passing device 0 status to SoundWire core.
