Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Users may disable HWP in firmware, in which case intel_pstate wouldn't load
unless the CPU model is explicitly supported.

Add TIGERLAKE to the list of CPUs that can register intel_pstate while not
advertising the HWP capability. Without this change, an TIGERLAKE in no-HWP
mode could only use the acpi_cpufreq frequency scaling driver.
