Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-517.el8/c1031177.failed

Unlike header read-in, parent info read-in is already decoupled in
get_parent_info(), but it's buried in rbd_dev_v2_parent_info() along
with the processing logic.

Separate the initial read-in and update read-in logic into
rbd_dev_setup_parent() and rbd_dev_update_parent() respectively and
have rbd_dev_v2_parent_info() just populate struct parent_image_info
(i.e. what get_parent_info() did).  Some existing QoI issues, like
flatten of a standalone clone being disregarded on refresh, remain.
