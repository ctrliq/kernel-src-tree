When KASLR is enabled, the KASLR_FLAG bit in boot_params->hdr.loadflags
should be set to 1 to propagate KASLR status from compressed kernel to
kernel, just as the choose_random_location() function does.

Currently, when the kernel is booted via the EFI stub, the KASLR_FLAG
bit in boot_params->hdr.loadflags is not set, even though it should be.
This causes some functions, such as kernel_randomize_memory(), not to
execute as expected. Fix it.
