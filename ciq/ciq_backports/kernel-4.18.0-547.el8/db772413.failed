Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Now that the x86 EFI stub calls into some APIs exposed by the
decompressor (e.g., kaslr_get_random_long()), it is necessary to ensure
that the global boot_params variable is set correctly before doing so.

Note that the decompressor and the kernel proper carry conflicting
declarations for the global variable 'boot_params' so refer to it via an
alias to work around this.
