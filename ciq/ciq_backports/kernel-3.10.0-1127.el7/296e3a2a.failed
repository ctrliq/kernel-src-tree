Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1127.el7/296e3a2a.failed

The device requires that memory registration work requests that update the
address translation table of a MR will be fenced if posted together.  This
scenario can happen when address ranges are invalidated by the mmu in
separate concurrent calls to the invalidation callback.

We prefer to block concurrent address updates for a single MR over fencing
since making the decision if a WQE needs fencing will be more expensive
and fencing all WQEs is a too radical choice.

Further, it isn't clear that this code can even run safely concurrently,
so a lock is a safer choice.
