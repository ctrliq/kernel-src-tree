Commit a5681e20b541 ("net/ibmnvic: Fix deadlock problem in reset")
made the change to hold the RTNL lock during a reset to avoid deadlock
but linkwatch_event is fired during the reset and needs the RTNL lock.
That keeps linkwatch_event process from proceeding until the reset
is complete. The reset process cannot tolerate the linkwatch_event
processing after reset completes, so release the RTNL lock during the
process to allow a chance for linkwatch_event to run during reset.
This does not guarantee that the linkwatch_event will be processed as
soon as link state changes, but is an improvement over the current code
where linkwatch_event processing is always delayed, which prevents
transmissions on the device from being deactivated leading transmit
watchdog timer to time-out.

Release the RTNL lock before link state change and re-acquire after
the link state change to allow linkwatch_event to grab the RTNL lock
and run during the reset.
