Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1127.el7/438b43bd.failed

desc_cnt and data_cnt should always be equal. In the case of a dropped
packet desc_cnt was still getting updated (correctly), data_cnt
was not. To eliminate this bug and prevent it from recurring this
patch combines them into one ring level cnt.
