Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-rt-4.18.0-477.27.1.rt7.290.el8_8/ee633afd.failed

On module unload wait for relese callback for each packag_die entry
and then free the memory. This is done by waiting on a completion
object, till release() callback.

While here, also change to kobject_init_and_add() to
kobject_create_and_add() to simplify.
