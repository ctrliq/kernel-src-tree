Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-553.82.1.el8_10/1913e111.failed

Mount will hang if using SMB1 and DFS.

This is because every call to get_next_mid() will, unconditionally,
mark tcpStatus to CifsNeedReconnect before even establishing the
initial connect, because "reconnect" variable was not initialized.

Initializing "reconnect" to false fix this issue.
