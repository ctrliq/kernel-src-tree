Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-502.el8/1a63b580.failed

Issues with user interface [1] to load scan test images have been
addressed so remove the dependency on BROKEN.
