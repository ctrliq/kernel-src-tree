commit 10d4853e4c5cd64b9ef1e5579bb2e89bceab4175
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-502.el8/10d4853e.failed

CONFIG_INTEL_IFS_DEVICE is not used anywhere. The selection in
Kconfig is therefore pointless. Delete it.
