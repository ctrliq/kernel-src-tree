Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-502.el8/badb81a5.failed

The driver is using functions from a compilation unit which is enabled
by CONFIG_CPU_SUP_INTEL. Add that dependency to Kconfig explicitly
otherwise:

  drivers/platform/x86/intel/ifs/load.o: in function `ifs_load_firmware':
  load.c:(.text+0x3b8): undefined reference to `intel_cpu_collect_info'
