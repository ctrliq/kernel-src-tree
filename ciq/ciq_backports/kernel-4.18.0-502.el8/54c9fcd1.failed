Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-502.el8/54c9fcd1.failed

The struct holding device driver data contained both read only(ro)
and read write(rw) fields.

Separating ro fields from rw fields was recommended as
a preferable design pattern during review[1].

Group ro fields into a separate const struct. Associate it to
the miscdevice being registered by keeping its pointer in the
same container struct as the miscdevice.
