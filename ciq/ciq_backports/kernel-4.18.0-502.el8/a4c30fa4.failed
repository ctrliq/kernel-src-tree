Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-502.el8/a4c30fa4.failed

IFS test image is unnecessarily loaded during driver initialization.
Drop image loading during ifs_init() and improve module load time. With
this change, user has to load one when starting the tests.

As a consequence, make ifs_sem static as it is only used within sysfs.c
