Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

The interface to trigger Array BIST test and obtain its result
is similar to the existing scan test. The only notable
difference is that, Array BIST doesn't require any test content
to be loaded. So binary load related options are not needed for
this test.

Add sysfs interface for array BIST test, the testing support will
be added by subsequent patch.
