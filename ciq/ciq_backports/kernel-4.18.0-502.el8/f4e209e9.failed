Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-502.el8/f4e209e9.failed

scan_chunks_sanity_check() returns -ENOMEM if it encounters an error
while copying IFS test image from memory to Secure Memory.

Return -EIO in this scenario, as it is more appropriate.
