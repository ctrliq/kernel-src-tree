Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-502.el8/563ca0e9.failed

The "port" comes from the user and if it is zero then the:

	ndev = mc->ports[port - 1];

assignment does an out of bounds read.  I have changed the if
statement to fix this and to mirror how it is done in
mana_ib_create_qp_rss().
