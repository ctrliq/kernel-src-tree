Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Array BIST test (for a particular core) is triggered by writing
to MSR_ARRAY_BIST from one sibling of the core.

This will initiate a test for all supported arrays on that
CPU. Array BIST test may be aborted before completing all the
arrays in the event of an interrupt or other reasons.
In this case, kernel will restart the test from that point
onwards. Array test will also be aborted when the test fails,
in which case the test is stopped immediately without further
retry.
