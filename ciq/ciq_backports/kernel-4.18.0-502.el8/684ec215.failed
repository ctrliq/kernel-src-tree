The IFS image contains hashes that will be used to authenticate the ifs
test chunks. First, use WRMSR to copy the hashes and enumerate the number
of test chunks, chunk size and the maximum number of cores that can run
scan test simultaneously.

Next, use WRMSR to authenticate each and every scan test chunk which is
stored in the IFS image. The CPU will check if the test chunks match
the hashes, otherwise failure is indicated to system software. If the test
chunk is authenticated, it is automatically copied to secured memory.

Use schedule_work_on() to perform the hash copy and authentication. Note
this needs only be done on the first logical cpu of each socket.
