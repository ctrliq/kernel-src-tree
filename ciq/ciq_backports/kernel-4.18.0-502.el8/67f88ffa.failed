Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-502.el8/67f88ffa.failed

In preparation to supporting additional tests, remove ifs_pkg_auth
from per-test scope, as it is only applicable for one test type.

This will simplify ifs_init() flow when multiple tests are added.
