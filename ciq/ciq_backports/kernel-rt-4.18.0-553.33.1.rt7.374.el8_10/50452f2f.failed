After the commit in the Fixes: line below, HPD polling stopped working
on i915, since after that change calling drm_kms_helper_poll_enable()
doesn't restart drm_mode_config::output_poll_work if the work was
stopped (no connectors needing polling) and enabling polling for a
connector (during runtime suspend or detecting an HPD IRQ storm).

After the above change calling drm_kms_helper_poll_enable() is a nop
after it's been called already and polling for some connectors was
disabled/re-enabled.

Fix this by calling drm_kms_helper_poll_reschedule() added in the
previous patch instead, which reschedules the work whenever expected.

Fixes: d33a54e3991d ("drm/probe_helper: sort out poll_running vs poll_enabled")
