Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-526.el8/d629c0e2.failed

The USS720 parport driver source code is in drivers/usb/misc/, the
corresponding config is defined in drivers/usb/Kconfig. Some digging in the
kernel's history revealed no good reason why it needs to be defined in
USB's top-level Kconfig file, and why the config for the USS720 parport
driver should be the first in the list of USB port drivers, while all other
configs for drivers in drivers/usb/misc are in the USB Miscellaneous driver
configuration file.

Most probably, it was simply considered a bit more special when the USB
Miscellaneous driver configuration file (drivers/usb/misc/Config.in back
then) was initially created, and this config simply survived to remain at
the top-level USB Kconfig file with all further code/Kconfig
transformations and additions later on. Users rarely notice this config
being at this position, as CONFIG_PARPORT (Parallel port support) needs to
be enabled and only few users enable that. Nowadays, this USB_USS720 driver
is probably not that special that it needs to be listed as first item of
the USB port drivers.

Move the configuration of the USS720 parport driver to the top of the USB
Miscellaneous drivers section, as the configurations does not have a lot of
specific ordering USB Miscellaneous drivers. This way, the USS720 parport
driver is moved to the comment "USB Miscellaneous drivers", fitting to the
driver's source code location, but still is at the top of the list for
those few acquainted users of Kconfig UIs that might be looking for the
config that was once at the top of the list of the USB port drivers.

Put this config definition to a more local place. No semantic change.
