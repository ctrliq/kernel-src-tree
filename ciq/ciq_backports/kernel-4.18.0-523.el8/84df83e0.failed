++<<<<<<< HEAD:Documentation/networking/bonding.txt
 +        Specify the delay, in milliseconds, between each peer
 +        notification (gratuitous ARP and unsolicited IPv6 Neighbor
 +        Advertisement) when they are issued after a failover event.
 +        This delay should be a multiple of the link monitor interval
 +        (arp_interval or miimon, whichever is active). The default
 +        value is 0 which means to match the value of the link monitor
 +        interval.
++=======
+ 	Specify the delay, in milliseconds, between each peer
+ 	notification (gratuitous ARP and unsolicited IPv6 Neighbor
+ 	Advertisement) when they are issued after a failover event.
+ 	This delay should be a multiple of the MII link monitor interval
+ 	(miimon).
+ 
+ 	The valid range is 0 - 300000. The default value is 0, which means
+ 	to match the value of the MII link monitor interval.
+ 
+ prio
+ 	Slave priority. A higher number means higher priority.
+ 	The primary slave has the highest priority. This option also
+ 	follows the primary_reselect rules.
+ 
+ 	This option could only be configured via netlink, and is only valid
+ 	for active-backup(1), balance-tlb (5) and balance-alb (6) mode.
+ 	The valid value range is a signed 32 bit integer.
+ 
+ 	The default value is 0.
