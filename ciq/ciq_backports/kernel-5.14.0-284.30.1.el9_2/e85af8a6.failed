commit e85af8a641ba3e8e4dab3e82f4a17f06378d47ff
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-5.14.0-284.30.1.el9_2/e85af8a6.failed

Update the jaketown metrics and events using the new tooling from:

  https://github.com/intel/perfmon

The metrics are unchanged but the formulas differ due to parentheses,
use of exponents and removal of redundant operations like "* 1".  The
events are unchanged but unused json values are removed. The
formatting changes increase consistency across the json files.

In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four 'fits', each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI 'speed' (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the 'transfers' here refer to 'fits'.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 'flit' at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as 'data' bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual 'data' and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate 'data' bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.",
