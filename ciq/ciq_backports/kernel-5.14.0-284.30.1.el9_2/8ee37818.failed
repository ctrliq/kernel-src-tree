commit 8ee37818a0574fac9d42344595236099c153a494
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-5.14.0-284.30.1.el9_2/8ee37818.failed

Update the ivytown metrics and events using the new tooling from:

  https://github.com/intel/perfmon

The metrics are unchanged but the formulas differ due to parentheses,
use of exponents and removal of redundant operations like "* 1".  The
events are unchanged but unused json values are removed. The
formatting changes increase consistency across the json files.
