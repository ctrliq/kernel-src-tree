Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-5.14.0-284.30.1.el9_2/fb509f76.failed

Guests like grsecurity that make heavy use of CR0.WP to implement kernel
level W^X will suffer from the implied VMEXITs.

With EPT there is no need to intercept a guest change of CR0.WP, so
simply make it a guest owned bit if we can do so.

This implies that a read of a guest's CR0.WP bit might need a VMREAD.
However, the only potentially affected user seems to be kvm_init_mmu()
which is a heavy operation to begin with. But also most callers already
cache the full value of CR0 anyway, so no additional VMREAD is needed.
The only exception is nested_vmx_load_cr3().

This change is VMX-specific, as SVM has no such fine grained control
register intercept control.
