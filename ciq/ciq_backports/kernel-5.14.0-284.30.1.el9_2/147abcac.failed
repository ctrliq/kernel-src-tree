Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-5.14.0-284.30.1.el9_2/147abcac.failed

The following request sequence to the same file causes the NFS client and
server getting into an infinite loop with COMMIT and NFS4ERR_DELAY:

OPEN
REMOVE
WRITE
COMMIT

Problem reported by recall11, recall12, recall14, recall20, recall22,
recall40, recall42, recall48, recall50 of nfstest suite.

This patch restores the handling of race condition in nfsd_file_do_acquire
with unlink to that prior of the regression.
