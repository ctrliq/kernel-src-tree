commit 87eb04bb87fbdf1d53f0fc64e6fc56ba2b504762
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-425.3.1.el8/87eb04bb.failed

Add CLSA0101 id to the ignore_serial_bus_ids
so serial-multi-instantiate can correctly
instantiate the driver.
