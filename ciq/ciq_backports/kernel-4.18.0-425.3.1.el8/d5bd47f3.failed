Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-425.3.1.el8/d5bd47f3.failed

We have sanity checks for byte controls and if any of the fail the locally
allocated scontrol->ipc_control_data is freed up, but not set to NULL.

On a rollback path of the error the higher level code will also try to free
the scontrol->ipc_control_data which will eventually going to lead to
memory corruption as double freeing memory is not a good thing.
