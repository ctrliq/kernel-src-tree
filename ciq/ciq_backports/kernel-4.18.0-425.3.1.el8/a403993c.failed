Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-425.3.1.el8/a403993c.failed

Since the scontrol->priv is freed up during load operation it should be set
to NULL to be safe against double freeing attempt.
