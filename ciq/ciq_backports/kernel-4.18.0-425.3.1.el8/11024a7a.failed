Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

The guest in vgic_irq gets its arguments in a struct. This struct used
to fit nicely in a single register so vcpu_args_set() was able to pass
it by value by setting x0 with it. Unfortunately, this args struct grew
after some commits and some guest args became random (specically
kvm_supports_irqfd).

Fix this by passing the guest args as a pointer (after allocating some
guest memory for it).
