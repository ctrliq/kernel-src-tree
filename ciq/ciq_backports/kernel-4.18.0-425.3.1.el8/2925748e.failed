The firmware coefficient files contain version information that is
currently ignored by the cs_dsp code. This information specifies which
version of the firmware the coefficient were generated for. Add a check
into the code which prints a warning in the case the coefficient and
firmware differ in version, in many cases this will be ok but it is not
always, so best to let the user know there is a potential issue.
