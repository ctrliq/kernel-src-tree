Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-425.3.1.el8/a164ff53.failed

We have a couple of users of this helper, make it available for them.

The prototype for the helper is specifically crafted in order to be
easily used with bus_find_device() call. That's why its location is
in the driver core rather than ACPI.
