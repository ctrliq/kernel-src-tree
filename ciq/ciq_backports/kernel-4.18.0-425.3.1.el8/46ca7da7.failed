Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-425.3.1.el8/46ca7da7.failed

Send DPCD SET_POWER command to downstream in .atomic_disable to make the
downstream monitor enter the power down mode, so the device suspend won't
be affected.
