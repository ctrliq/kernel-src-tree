commit a5cd38fd9c47b23abc6df08d6ee6a71b39038185
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-425.3.1.el8/a5cd38fd.failed

Fix the formatting of some comments and the wording of one of them (in
gicv3_access_reg).
