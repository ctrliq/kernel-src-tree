The support for xHCI controllers with only one roothub, and the code
to defer primary roothub registation until second roothub got merged
to usb-next for 5.19 at the same time.

commit 873f323618c2 ("xhci: prepare for operation w/o shared hcd")
commit b7a4f9b5d0e4 ("xhci: Set HCD flag to defer primary roothub
registration")

These got merged in such a way that the flag to defer primary roothub
registration is set even for xHC controllers with just one roothub.

Fix this by setting the defer flag in a codepath taken only if we have
two roothubs
