Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-425.3.1.el8/1bfa4d0c.failed

The prefetch is incorrectly using the dma address instead of the virtual
address.

It's supposed to be:
prefetch((char *)buf_state->page_info.page_address +
	 buf_state->page_info.page_offset)

However, after correcting this mistake, there is no evidence of
performance improvement.
