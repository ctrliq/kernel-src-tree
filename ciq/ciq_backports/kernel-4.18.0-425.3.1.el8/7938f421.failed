Rename struct dma_buf_map to struct iosys_map and corresponding APIs.
Over time dma-buf-map grew up to more functionality than the one used by
dma-buf: in fact it's just a shim layer to abstract system memory, that
can be accessed via regular load and store, from IO memory that needs to
be acessed via arch helpers.

The idea is to extend this API so it can fulfill other needs, internal
to a single driver. Example: in the i915 driver it's desired to share
the implementation for integrated graphics, which uses mostly system
memory, with discrete graphics, which may need to access IO memory.

The conversion was mostly done with the following semantic patch:

	@r1@
	@@
	- struct dma_buf_map
	+ struct iosys_map

	@r2@

Then some files had their includes adjusted and some comments were
update to remove mentions to dma-buf-map.

Since this is not specific to dma-buf anymore, move the documentation to
the "Bus-Independent Device Accesses" section.

v2:
  - Squash patches

v3:
  - Fix wrong removal of dma-buf.h from MAINTAINERS
  - Move documentation from dma-buf.rst to device-io.rst

v4:
  - Change documentation title and level

+ __iomem pointer tokens
+ ======================
+ 
+ The data type for an MMIO address is an ``__iomem`` qualified pointer, such as
+ ``void __iomem *reg``. On most architectures it is a regular pointer that
+ points to a virtual memory address and can be offset or dereferenced, but in
+ portable code, it must only be passed from and to functions that explicitly
+ operated on an ``__iomem`` token, in particular the ioremap() and
+ readl()/writel() functions. The 'sparse' semantic code checker can be used to
+ verify that this is done correctly.
+ 
+ While on most architectures, ioremap() creates a page table entry for an
+ uncached virtual address pointing to the physical MMIO address, some
+ architectures require special instructions for MMIO, and the ``__iomem`` pointer
+ just encodes the physical address or an offsettable cookie that is interpreted
+ by readl()/writel().
+ 
+ Differences between I/O access functions
+ ========================================
+ 
+ readq(), readl(), readw(), readb(), writeq(), writel(), writew(), writeb()
+ 
+   These are the most generic accessors, providing serialization against other
+   MMIO accesses and DMA accesses as well as fixed endianness for accessing
+   little-endian PCI devices and on-chip peripherals. Portable device drivers
+   should generally use these for any access to ``__iomem`` pointers.
+ 
+   Note that posted writes are not strictly ordered against a spinlock, see
+   Documentation/driver-api/io_ordering.rst.
+ 
+ readq_relaxed(), readl_relaxed(), readw_relaxed(), readb_relaxed(),
+ writeq_relaxed(), writel_relaxed(), writew_relaxed(), writeb_relaxed()
+ 
+   On architectures that require an expensive barrier for serializing against
+   DMA, these "relaxed" versions of the MMIO accessors only serialize against
+   each other, but contain a less expensive barrier operation. A device driver
+   might use these in a particularly performance sensitive fast path, with a
+   comment that explains why the usage in a specific location is safe without
+   the extra barriers.
+ 
+   See memory-barriers.txt for a more detailed discussion on the precise ordering
+   guarantees of the non-relaxed and relaxed versions.
+ 
+ ioread64(), ioread32(), ioread16(), ioread8(),
+ iowrite64(), iowrite32(), iowrite16(), iowrite8()
+ 
+   These are an alternative to the normal readl()/writel() functions, with almost
+   identical behavior, but they can also operate on ``__iomem`` tokens returned
+   for mapping PCI I/O space with pci_iomap() or ioport_map(). On architectures
+   that require special instructions for I/O port access, this adds a small
+   overhead for an indirect function call implemented in lib/iomap.c, while on
+   other architectures, these are simply aliases.
+ 
+ ioread64be(), ioread32be(), ioread16be()
+ iowrite64be(), iowrite32be(), iowrite16be()
+ 
+   These behave in the same way as the ioread32()/iowrite32() family, but with
+   reversed byte order, for accessing devices with big-endian MMIO registers.
+   Device drivers that can operate on either big-endian or little-endian
+   registers may have to implement a custom wrapper function that picks one or
+   the other depending on which device was found.
+ 
+   Note: On some architectures, the normal readl()/writel() functions
+   traditionally assume that devices are the same endianness as the CPU, while
+   using a hardware byte-reverse on the PCI bus when running a big-endian kernel.
+   Drivers that use readl()/writel() this way are generally not portable, but
+   tend to be limited to a particular SoC.
+ 
+ hi_lo_readq(), lo_hi_readq(), hi_lo_readq_relaxed(), lo_hi_readq_relaxed(),
+ ioread64_lo_hi(), ioread64_hi_lo(), ioread64be_lo_hi(), ioread64be_hi_lo(),
+ hi_lo_writeq(), lo_hi_writeq(), hi_lo_writeq_relaxed(), lo_hi_writeq_relaxed(),
+ iowrite64_lo_hi(), iowrite64_hi_lo(), iowrite64be_lo_hi(), iowrite64be_hi_lo()
+ 
+   Some device drivers have 64-bit registers that cannot be accessed atomically
+   on 32-bit architectures but allow two consecutive 32-bit accesses instead.
+   Since it depends on the particular device which of the two halves has to be
+   accessed first, a helper is provided for each combination of 64-bit accessors
+   with either low/high or high/low word ordering. A device driver must include
+   either <linux/io-64-nonatomic-lo-hi.h> or <linux/io-64-nonatomic-hi-lo.h> to
+   get the function definitions along with helpers that redirect the normal
+   readq()/writeq() to them on architectures that do not provide 64-bit access
+   natively.
+ 
+ __raw_readq(), __raw_readl(), __raw_readw(), __raw_readb(),
+ __raw_writeq(), __raw_writel(), __raw_writew(), __raw_writeb()
+ 
+   These are low-level MMIO accessors without barriers or byteorder changes and
+   architecture specific behavior. Accesses are usually atomic in the sense that
+   a four-byte __raw_readl() does not get split into individual byte loads, but
+   multiple consecutive accesses can be combined on the bus. In portable code, it
+   is only safe to use these to access memory behind a device bus but not MMIO
+   registers, as there are no ordering guarantees with regard to other MMIO
+   accesses or even spinlocks. The byte order is generally the same as for normal
+   memory, so unlike the other functions, these can be used to copy data between
+   kernel memory and device memory.
+ 
+ inl(), inw(), inb(), outl(), outw(), outb()
+ 
+   PCI I/O port resources traditionally require separate helpers as they are
+   implemented using special instructions on the x86 architecture. On most other
+   architectures, these are mapped to readl()/writel() style accessors
+   internally, usually pointing to a fixed area in virtual memory. Instead of an
+   ``__iomem`` pointer, the address is a 32-bit integer token to identify a port
+   number. PCI requires I/O port access to be non-posted, meaning that an outb()
+   must complete before the following code executes, while a normal writeb() may
+   still be in progress. On architectures that correctly implement this, I/O port
+   access is therefore ordered against spinlocks. Many non-x86 PCI host bridge
+   implementations and CPU architectures however fail to implement non-posted I/O
+   space on PCI, so they can end up being posted on such hardware.
+ 
+   In some architectures, the I/O port number space has a 1:1 mapping to
+   ``__iomem`` pointers, but this is not recommended and device drivers should
+   not rely on that for portability. Similarly, an I/O port number as described
+   in a PCI base address register may not correspond to the port number as seen
+   by a device driver. Portable drivers need to read the port number for the
+   resource provided by the kernel.
+ 
+   There are no direct 64-bit I/O port accessors, but pci_iomap() in combination
+   with ioread64/iowrite64 can be used instead.
+ 
+ inl_p(), inw_p(), inb_p(), outl_p(), outw_p(), outb_p()
+ 
+   On ISA devices that require specific timing, the _p versions of the I/O
+   accessors add a small delay. On architectures that do not have ISA buses,
+   these are aliases to the normal inb/outb helpers.
+ 
+ readsq, readsl, readsw, readsb
+ writesq, writesl, writesw, writesb
+ ioread64_rep, ioread32_rep, ioread16_rep, ioread8_rep
+ iowrite64_rep, iowrite32_rep, iowrite16_rep, iowrite8_rep
+ insl, insw, insb, outsl, outsw, outsb
+ 
+   These are helpers that access the same address multiple times, usually to copy
+   data between kernel memory byte stream and a FIFO buffer. Unlike the normal
+   MMIO accessors, these do not perform a byteswap on big-endian kernels, so the
+   first byte in the FIFO register corresponds to the first byte in the memory
+   buffer regardless of the architecture.
+ 
+ Device memory mapping modes
+ ===========================
+ 
+ Some architectures support multiple modes for mapping device memory.
+ ioremap_*() variants provide a common abstraction around these
+ architecture-specific modes, with a shared set of semantics.
+ 
+ ioremap() is the most common mapping type, and is applicable to typical device
+ memory (e.g. I/O registers). Other modes can offer weaker or stronger
+ guarantees, if supported by the architecture. From most to least common, they
+ are as follows:
+ 
+ ioremap()
+ ---------
+ 
+ The default mode, suitable for most memory-mapped devices, e.g. control
+ registers. Memory mapped using ioremap() has the following characteristics:
+ 
+ * Uncached - CPU-side caches are bypassed, and all reads and writes are handled
+   directly by the device
+ * No speculative operations - the CPU may not issue a read or write to this
+   memory, unless the instruction that does so has been reached in committed
+   program flow.
+ * No reordering - The CPU may not reorder accesses to this memory mapping with
+   respect to each other. On some architectures, this relies on barriers in
+   readl_relaxed()/writel_relaxed().
+ * No repetition - The CPU may not issue multiple reads or writes for a single
+   program instruction.
+ * No write-combining - Each I/O operation results in one discrete read or write
+   being issued to the device, and multiple writes are not combined into larger
+   writes. This may or may not be enforced when using __raw I/O accessors or
+   pointer dereferences.
+ * Non-executable - The CPU is not allowed to speculate instruction execution
+   from this memory (it probably goes without saying, but you're also not
+   allowed to jump into device memory).
+ 
+ On many platforms and buses (e.g. PCI), writes issued through ioremap()
+ mappings are posted, which means that the CPU does not wait for the write to
+ actually reach the target device before retiring the write instruction.
+ 
+ On many platforms, I/O accesses must be aligned with respect to the access
+ size; failure to do so will result in an exception or unpredictable results.
+ 
+ ioremap_wc()
+ ------------
+ 
+ Maps I/O memory as normal memory with write combining. Unlike ioremap(),
+ 
+ * The CPU may speculatively issue reads from the device that the program
+   didn't actually execute, and may choose to basically read whatever it wants.
+ * The CPU may reorder operations as long as the result is consistent from the
+   program's point of view.
+ * The CPU may write to the same location multiple times, even when the program
+   issued a single write.
+ * The CPU may combine several writes into a single larger write.
+ 
+ This mode is typically used for video framebuffers, where it can increase
+ performance of writes. It can also be used for other blocks of memory in
+ devices (e.g. buffers or shared memory), but care must be taken as accesses are
+ not guaranteed to be ordered with respect to normal ioremap() MMIO register
+ accesses without explicit barriers.
+ 
+ On a PCI bus, it is usually safe to use ioremap_wc() on MMIO areas marked as
+ ``IORESOURCE_PREFETCH``, but it may not be used on those without the flag.
+ For on-chip devices, there is no corresponding flag, but a driver can use
+ ioremap_wc() on a device that is known to be safe.
+ 
+ ioremap_wt()
+ ------------
+ 
+ Maps I/O memory as normal memory with write-through caching. Like ioremap_wc(),
+ but also,
+ 
+ * The CPU may cache writes issued to and reads from the device, and serve reads
+   from that cache.
+ 
+ This mode is sometimes used for video framebuffers, where drivers still expect
+ writes to reach the device in a timely manner (and not be stuck in the CPU
+ cache), but reads may be served from the cache for efficiency. However, it is
+ rarely useful these days, as framebuffer drivers usually perform writes only,
+ for which ioremap_wc() is more efficient (as it doesn't needlessly trash the
+ cache). Most drivers should not use this.
+ 
+ ioremap_np()
+ ------------
+ 
+ Like ioremap(), but explicitly requests non-posted write semantics. On some
+ architectures and buses, ioremap() mappings have posted write semantics, which
+ means that writes can appear to "complete" from the point of view of the
+ CPU before the written data actually arrives at the target device. Writes are
+ still ordered with respect to other writes and reads from the same device, but
+ due to the posted write semantics, this is not the case with respect to other
+ devices. ioremap_np() explicitly requests non-posted semantics, which means
+ that the write instruction will not appear to complete until the device has
+ received (and to some platform-specific extent acknowledged) the written data.
+ 
+ This mapping mode primarily exists to cater for platforms with bus fabrics that
+ require this particular mapping mode to work correctly. These platforms set the
+ ``IORESOURCE_MEM_NONPOSTED`` flag for a resource that requires ioremap_np()
+ semantics and portable drivers should use an abstraction that automatically
+ selects it where appropriate (see the `Higher-level ioremap abstractions`_
+ section below).
+ 
+ The bare ioremap_np() is only available on some architectures; on others, it
+ always returns NULL. Drivers should not normally use it, unless they are
+ platform-specific or they derive benefit from non-posted writes where
+ supported, and can fall back to ioremap() otherwise. The normal approach to
+ ensure posted write completion is to do a dummy read after a write as
+ explained in `Accessing the device`_, which works with ioremap() on all
+ platforms.
+ 
+ ioremap_np() should never be used for PCI drivers. PCI memory space writes are
+ always posted, even on architectures that otherwise implement ioremap_np().
+ Using ioremap_np() for PCI BARs will at best result in posted write semantics,
+ and at worst result in complete breakage.
+ 
+ Note that non-posted write semantics are orthogonal to CPU-side ordering
+ guarantees. A CPU may still choose to issue other reads or writes before a
+ non-posted write instruction retires. See the previous section on MMIO access
+ functions for details on the CPU side of things.
+ 
+ ioremap_uc()
+ ------------
+ 
+ ioremap_uc() behaves like ioremap() except that on the x86 architecture without
+ 'PAT' mode, it marks memory as uncached even when the MTRR has designated
+ it as cacheable, see Documentation/x86/pat.rst.
+ 
+ Portable drivers should avoid the use of ioremap_uc().
+ 
+ ioremap_cache()
+ ---------------
+ 
+ ioremap_cache() effectively maps I/O memory as normal RAM. CPU write-back
+ caches can be used, and the CPU is free to treat the device as if it were a
+ block of RAM. This should never be used for device memory which has side
+ effects of any kind, or which does not return the data previously written on
+ read.
+ 
+ It should also not be used for actual RAM, as the returned pointer is an
+ ``__iomem`` token. memremap() can be used for mapping normal RAM that is outside
+ of the linear kernel memory area to a regular pointer.
+ 
+ Portable drivers should avoid the use of ioremap_cache().
+ 
+ Architecture example
+ --------------------
+ 
+ Here is how the above modes map to memory attribute settings on the ARM64
+ architecture:
+ 
+ +------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
+ | API                    | Memory region type and cacheability        |
+ +------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
+ | ioremap_np()           | Device-nGnRnE                              |
+ +------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
+ | ioremap()              | Device-nGnRE                               |
+ +------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
+ | ioremap_uc()           | (not implemented)                          |
+ +------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
+ | ioremap_wc()           | Normal-Non Cacheable                       |
+ +------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
+ | ioremap_wt()           | (not implemented; fallback to ioremap)     |
+ +------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
+ | ioremap_cache()        | Normal-Write-Back Cacheable                |
+ +------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
+ 
+ Higher-level ioremap abstractions
+ =================================
+ 
+ Instead of using the above raw ioremap() modes, drivers are encouraged to use
+ higher-level APIs. These APIs may implement platform-specific logic to
+ automatically choose an appropriate ioremap mode on any given bus, allowing for
+ a platform-agnostic driver to work on those platforms without any special
+ cases. At the time of this writing, the following ioremap() wrappers have such
+ logic:
+ 
+ devm_ioremap_resource()
+ 
+   Can automatically select ioremap_np() over ioremap() according to platform
+   requirements, if the ``IORESOURCE_MEM_NONPOSTED`` flag is set on the struct
+   resource. Uses devres to automatically unmap the resource when the driver
+   probe() function fails or a device in unbound from its driver.
+ 
+   Documented in Documentation/driver-api/driver-model/devres.rst.
+ 
+ of_address_to_resource()
+ 
+   Automatically sets the ``IORESOURCE_MEM_NONPOSTED`` flag for platforms that
+   require non-posted writes for certain buses (see the nonposted-mmio and
+   posted-mmio device tree properties).
+ 
+ of_iomap()
+ 
+   Maps the resource described in a ``reg`` property in the device tree, doing
+   all required translations. Automatically selects ioremap_np() according to
+   platform requirements, as above.
+ 
+ pci_ioremap_bar(), pci_ioremap_wc_bar()
+ 
+   Maps the resource described in a PCI base address without having to extract
+   the physical address first.
+ 
+ pci_iomap(), pci_iomap_wc()
+ 
+   Like pci_ioremap_bar()/pci_ioremap_bar(), but also works on I/O space when
+   used together with ioread32()/iowrite32() and similar accessors
+ 
+ pcim_iomap()
+ 
+   Like pci_iomap(), but uses devres to automatically unmap the resource when
+   the driver probe() function fails or a device in unbound from its driver
+ 
+   Documented in Documentation/driver-api/driver-model/devres.rst.
+ 
+ Not using these wrappers may make drivers unusable on certain platforms with
+ stricter rules for mapping I/O memory.

 +Would be great to refactor this all into a set of small common helpers.
++=======
+ Reimplement functions in drm_fbdev_fb_ops without fbdev
+ -------------------------------------------------------
+ 
+ A number of callback functions in drm_fbdev_fb_ops could benefit from
+ being rewritten without dependencies on the fbdev module. Some of the
+ helpers could further benefit from using struct iosys_map instead of
+ raw pointers.
+ 
+ Contact: Thomas Zimmermann <tzimmermann@suse.de>, Daniel Vetter
+ 
+ Level: Advanced
+ 
+ 
+ drm_framebuffer_funcs and drm_mode_config_funcs.fb_create cleanup
+ -----------------------------------------------------------------
+ 
+ A lot more drivers could be switched over to the drm_gem_framebuffer helpers.
+ Various hold-ups:
+ 
+ - Need to switch over to the generic dirty tracking code using
+   drm_atomic_helper_dirtyfb first (e.g. qxl).
+ 
+ - Need to switch to drm_fbdev_generic_setup(), otherwise a lot of the custom fb
+   setup code can't be deleted.
+ 
+ - Many drivers wrap drm_gem_fb_create() only to check for valid formats. For
+   atomic drivers we could check for valid formats by calling
+   drm_plane_check_pixel_format() against all planes, and pass if any plane
+   supports the format. For non-atomic that's not possible since like the format
+   list for the primary plane is fake and we'd therefor reject valid formats.
+ 
+ - Many drivers subclass drm_framebuffer, we'd need a embedding compatible
+   version of the varios drm_gem_fb_create functions. Maybe called
+   drm_gem_fb_create/_with_dirty/_with_funcs as needed.

 -Replace drm_detect_hdmi_monitor() with drm_display_info.is_hdmi
 ----------------------------------------------------------------

 -Once EDID is parsed, the monitor HDMI support information is available through
 -drm_display_info.is_hdmi. Many drivers still call drm_detect_hdmi_monitor() to
 -retrieve the same information, which is less efficient.

 -Consolidate custom driver modeset properties
 +Add missing kerneldoc for exported functions
  --------------------------------------------
  
 -Before atomic modeset took place, many drivers where creating their own
 -properties. Among other things, atomic brought the requirement that custom,
 -driver specific properties should not be used.
 +The DRM reference documentation is still lacking kerneldoc in a few areas. The
 +task would be to clean up interfaces like moving functions around between
 +files to better group them and improving the interfaces like dropping return
 +values for functions that never fail. Then write kerneldoc for all exported
 +functions and an overview section and integrate it all into the drm book.
  
 -For this task, we aim to introduce core helpers or reuse the existing ones
 -if available:
 +See https://dri.freedesktop.org/docs/drm/ for what's there already.
  
 -A quick, unconfirmed, examples list.
 +Contact: Daniel Vetter
  
 -Introduce core helpers:
 -- audio (amdgpu, intel, gma500, radeon)
 -- brightness, contrast, etc (armada, nouveau) - overlay only (?)
 -- broadcast rgb (gma500, intel)
 -- colorkey (armada, nouveau, rcar) - overlay only (?)
 -- dither (amdgpu, nouveau, radeon) - varies across drivers
 -- underscan family (amdgpu, radeon, nouveau)
 +Hide legacy cruft better
 +------------------------
  
 -Already in core:
 -- colorspace (sti)
 -- tv format names, enhancements (gma500, intel)
 -- tv overscan, margins, etc. (gma500, intel)
 -- zorder (omapdrm) - same as zpos (?)
 +Way back DRM supported only drivers which shadow-attached to PCI devices with
 +userspace or fbdev drivers setting up outputs. Modern DRM drivers take charge
 +of the entire device, you can spot them with the DRIVER_MODESET flag.
  
 +Unfortunately there's still large piles of legacy code around which needs to
 +be hidden so that driver writers don't accidentally end up using it. And to
 +prevent security issues in those legacy IOCTLs from being exploited on modern
 +drivers. This has multiple possible subtasks:
  
 -Contact: Emil Velikov, respective driver maintainers
 +* Extract support code for legacy features into a ``drm-legacy.ko`` kernel
 +  module and compile it only when one of the legacy drivers is enabled.
  
 -Level: Intermediate
 +This is mostly done, the only thing left is to split up ``drm_irq.c`` into
 +legacy cruft and the parts needed by modern KMS drivers.

+ Use struct iosys_map throughout codebase
+ ----------------------------------------
+ 
+ Pointers to shared device memory are stored in struct iosys_map. Each
+ instance knows whether it refers to system or I/O memory. Most of the DRM-wide
+ interface have been converted to use struct iosys_map, but implementations
+ often still use raw pointers.
+ 
+ The task is to use struct iosys_map where it makes sense.
+ 
+ * Memory managers should use struct iosys_map for dma-buf-imported buffers.
+ * TTM might benefit from using struct iosys_map internally.
+ * Framebuffer copying and blitting helpers should operate on struct iosys_map.

+ Contact: Thomas Zimmermann <tzimmermann@suse.de>, Christian König, Daniel Vetter

+ Level: Intermediate
+ 
+ Review all drivers for setting struct drm_mode_config.{max_width,max_height} correctly
+ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ 
+ The values in struct drm_mode_config.{max_width,max_height} describe the
+ maximum supported framebuffer size. It's the virtual screen size, but many
+ drivers treat it like limitations of the physical resolution.
+ 
+ The maximum width depends on the hardware's maximum scanline pitch. The
+ maximum height depends on the amount of addressable video memory. Review all
+ drivers to initialize the fields to the correct values.

 -	 * below rules.
 -	 *
 -	 * - Drivers must add a shared fence through dma_resv_add_shared_fence()
 -	 *   for anything the userspace API considers a read access. This highly
 -	 *   depends upon the API and window system.
 -	 *
 -	 * - Similarly drivers must set the exclusive fence through
 -	 *   dma_resv_add_excl_fence() for anything the userspace API considers
 -	 *   write access.
 -	 *
 -	 * - Drivers may just always set the exclusive fence, since that only
 -	 *   causes unecessarily synchronization, but no correctness issues.
 -	 *
 -	 * - Some drivers only expose a synchronous userspace API with no
 -	 *   pipelining across drivers. These do not set any fences for their
 -	 *   access. An example here is v4l.
 -	 *
 -	 * DYNAMIC IMPORTER RULES:
 -	 *
 -	 * Dynamic importers, see dma_buf_attachment_is_dynamic(), have
 -	 * additional constraints on how they set up fences:
 -	 *
 -	 * - Dynamic importers must obey the exclusive fence and wait for it to
 -	 *   signal before allowing access to the buffer's underlying storage
 -	 *   through the device.
 -	 *
 -	 * - Dynamic importers should set fences for any access that they can't
 -	 *   disable immediately from their &dma_buf_attach_ops.move_notify
 -	 *   callback.
 -	 *
 -	 * IMPORTANT:
 -	 *
 -	 * All drivers must obey the struct dma_resv rules, specifically the
 -	 * rules for updating fences, see &dma_resv.fence_excl and
 -	 * &dma_resv.fence. If these dependency rules are broken access tracking
 -	 * can be lost resulting in use after free issues.

-/**
- * DOC: overview
- *
- * Calling dma-buf's vmap operation returns a pointer to the buffer's memory.
- * Depending on the location of the buffer, users may have to access it with
- * I/O operations or memory load/store operations. For example, copying to
- * system memory could be done with memcpy(), copying to I/O memory would be
- * done with memcpy_toio().
- *
- * .. code-block:: c
- *
- *	void *vaddr = ...; // pointer to system memory
- *	memcpy(vaddr, src, len);
- *
- *	void *vaddr_iomem = ...; // pointer to I/O memory
- *	memcpy_toio(vaddr, _iomem, src, len);
- *
- * When using dma-buf's vmap operation, the returned pointer is encoded as
- * :c:type:`struct dma_buf_map <dma_buf_map>`.
- * :c:type:`struct dma_buf_map <dma_buf_map>` stores the buffer's address in
- * system or I/O memory and a flag that signals the required method of
- * accessing the buffer. Use the returned instance and the helper functions
- * to access the buffer's memory in the correct way.
- *
- * The type :c:type:`struct dma_buf_map <dma_buf_map>` and its helpers are
- * actually independent from the dma-buf infrastructure. When sharing buffers
- * among devices, drivers have to know the location of the memory to access
- * the buffers in a safe way. :c:type:`struct dma_buf_map <dma_buf_map>`
- * solves this problem for dma-buf and its users. If other drivers or
- * sub-systems require similar functionality, the type could be generalized
- * and moved to a more prominent header file.
- *
- * Open-coding access to :c:type:`struct dma_buf_map <dma_buf_map>` is
- * considered bad style. Rather then accessing its fields directly, use one
- * of the provided helper functions, or implement your own. For example,
- * instances of :c:type:`struct dma_buf_map <dma_buf_map>` can be initialized
- * statically with DMA_BUF_MAP_INIT_VADDR(), or at runtime with
- * dma_buf_map_set_vaddr(). These helpers will set an address in system memory.
- *
- * .. code-block:: c
- *
- *	struct dma_buf_map map = DMA_BUF_MAP_INIT_VADDR(0xdeadbeaf);
- *
- *	dma_buf_map_set_vaddr(&map. 0xdeadbeaf);
- *
- * To set an address in I/O memory, use dma_buf_map_set_vaddr_iomem().
- *
- * .. code-block:: c
- *
- *	dma_buf_map_set_vaddr_iomem(&map. 0xdeadbeaf);
- *
- * Instances of struct dma_buf_map do not have to be cleaned up, but
- * can be cleared to NULL with dma_buf_map_clear(). Cleared mappings
- * always refer to system memory.
- *
- * .. code-block:: c
- *
- *	dma_buf_map_clear(&map);
- *
- * Test if a mapping is valid with either dma_buf_map_is_set() or
- * dma_buf_map_is_null().
- *
- * .. code-block:: c
- *
- *	if (dma_buf_map_is_set(&map) != dma_buf_map_is_null(&map))
- *		// always true
- *
- * Instances of :c:type:`struct dma_buf_map <dma_buf_map>` can be compared
- * for equality with dma_buf_map_is_equal(). Mappings the point to different
- * memory spaces, system or I/O, are never equal. That's even true if both
- * spaces are located in the same address space, both mappings contain the
- * same address value, or both mappings refer to NULL.
- *
- * .. code-block:: c
- *
- *	struct dma_buf_map sys_map; // refers to system memory
- *	struct dma_buf_map io_map; // refers to I/O memory
- *
- *	if (dma_buf_map_is_equal(&sys_map, &io_map))
- *		// always false
- *
- * A set up instance of struct dma_buf_map can be used to access or manipulate
- * the buffer memory. Depending on the location of the memory, the provided
- * helpers will pick the correct operations. Data can be copied into the memory
- * with dma_buf_map_memcpy_to(). The address can be manipulated with
- * dma_buf_map_incr().
- *
- * .. code-block:: c
- *
- *	const void *src = ...; // source buffer
- *	size_t len = ...; // length of src
- *
- *	dma_buf_map_memcpy_to(&map, src, len);
