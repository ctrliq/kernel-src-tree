Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-425.3.1.el8/6e4320d8.failed

The test key now needs to be manually held when calling
cs35l41_register_errata_patch, after patch:

Add the missing function calls to this driver.
