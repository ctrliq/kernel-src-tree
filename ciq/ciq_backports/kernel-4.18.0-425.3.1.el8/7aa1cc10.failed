Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-425.3.1.el8/7aa1cc10.failed

If the Halo registers are kept in the register cache the
HALO_CORE_RESET bit will be retained as 1 after reset is triggered in
cs_dsp_halo_start_core. This will cause subsequent writes to reset
the core which is not desired. Apart from this bit the rest of the
register bits are cacheable, so for safety sake clear the bit to
ensure the cache is consistent.
