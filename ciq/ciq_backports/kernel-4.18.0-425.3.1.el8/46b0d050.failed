Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-425.3.1.el8/46b0d050.failed

The mixer controls for ASP TX3/4 are set to values that are not included
in their enumeration control. This will cause spurious event
notifications when the controls are first changed, as the register value
changes whilst the actual visible enumeration value does not. Use the
register patch to set them to a known value, zero, which equates to zero
fill, thereby avoiding the spurious notifications.
