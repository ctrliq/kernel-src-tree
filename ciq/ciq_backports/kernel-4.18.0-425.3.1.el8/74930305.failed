Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-425.3.1.el8/74930305.failed

This patch removes unused included header files and moves others into
cs_dsp.h to ensure that types referenced in the header file are properly
described to prevent compiler warnings.
