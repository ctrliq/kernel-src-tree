regmap_register_patch can't be used to apply the probe sequence as a
patch is already registers with the regmap by
cs35l41_register_errata_patch and only a single patch can be attached to
a single regmap. The driver doesn't currently rely on a cache sync to
re-apply this probe sequence so simply switch it to a multi write.
