During TC action parsing, the can_offload callback is called
before calling the action's main parsing callback.

Later on, the can_offload callback is called again before handling
the action's post_parse callback if exists.

Since the main parsing callback might have changed and set parsing
params for the rule, following can_offload checks might fail because
some parsing params were already set.

Specifically, the ct action main parsing sets the ct param in the
parsing status structure and when the second can_offload for ct action
is called, before handling the ct post parsing, it will return an error
since it checks this ct param to indicate multiple ct actions which are
not supported.

Therefore, the can_offload call is removed from the post parsing
handling to prevent such cases.
This is allowed since the first can_offload call will ensure that the
action can be offloaded and the fact the code reached the post parsing
handling already means that the action can be offloaded.
