Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-425.3.1.el8/d1c80876.failed

The SOF topology supports 2 BE Links(dmic01 and dmic16k) and each
link supports up to four DMICs. However, Chromebook does not implement
ACPI NHLT table so the mach->mach_params.dmic_num is always zero. We
add a quirk so machine driver knows it's running on a Chromebook and
need to create BE Links for DMIC.
