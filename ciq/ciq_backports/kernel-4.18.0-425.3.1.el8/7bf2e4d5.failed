Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-425.3.1.el8/7bf2e4d5.failed

The "data_info" struct is copied to the user.  It has a 4 byte struct
hole after the last struct member so we need to memset that to avoid
copying uninitialized stack data to the user.
