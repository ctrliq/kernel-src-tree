Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-425.3.1.el8/bebd8f3f.failed

Add injection tests that use writing into the ISPENDR register (to mark
IRQs as pending). This is typically used by migration code.
