Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-425.3.1.el8/b53de63a.failed

vgic_poke_irq() checks that the attr argument passed to the vgic device
ioctl is sane. Make this check tighter by moving it to after the last
attr update.
