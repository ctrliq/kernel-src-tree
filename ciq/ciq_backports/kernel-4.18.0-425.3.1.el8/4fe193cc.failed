The ice_reset_vf function returns a boolean value indicating whether or
not the VF reset. This is a bit confusing since it means that callers
need to know how to interpret the return value when needing to indicate
an error.

Refactor the function and call sites to report a regular error code. We
still report success (i.e. return 0) in cases where the reset is in
progress or is disabled.

Existing callers don't care because they do not check the return value.
We keep the error code anyways instead of a void return because we
expect future code which may care about or at least report the error
value.
