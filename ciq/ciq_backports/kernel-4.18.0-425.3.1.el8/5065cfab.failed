Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-425.3.1.el8/5065cfab.failed

Some of the control functions exposed by the cs_dsp code require the
pwr_lock to be held by the caller. Add lockdep_assert_held calls to
ensure this is done correctly.
