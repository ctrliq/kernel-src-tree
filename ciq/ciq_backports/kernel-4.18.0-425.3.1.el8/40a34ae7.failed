Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-425.3.1.el8/40a34ae7.failed

The coefficient file contains various info strings, and the equivalent
strings are printed from the WMFW file as it is loaded. Add support
for printing these from the coefficient file as well.
