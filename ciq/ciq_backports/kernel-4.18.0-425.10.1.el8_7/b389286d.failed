For G200_SE_A, PLL M setting is wrong, which leads to blank screen,
or "signal out of range" on VGA display.
previous code had "m |= 0x80" which was changed to
m |= ((pixpllcn & BIT(8)) >> 1);

Tested on G200_SE_A rev 42

This line of code was moved to another file with
commit 877507bb954e ("drm/mgag200: Provide per-device callbacks for
PIXPLLC") but can be easily backported before this commit.

v2: * put BIT(7) First to respect MSB-to-LSB (Thomas)
    * Add a comment to explain that this bit must be set (Thomas)
