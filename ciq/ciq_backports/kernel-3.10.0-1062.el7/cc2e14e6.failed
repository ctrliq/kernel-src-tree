commit cc2e14e68004e6dec70842f990085f67c1f6fec7
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/cc2e14e6.failed

Commands that are reading/writing to objects can test for an ongoing
disassociation during their initial call to rdma_lookup_get_uobject.  This
directly prevents all of these commands from conflicting with an ongoing
disassociation.
