Add a new if_not_guard() macro to cleanup.h for handling
conditional guards such as mutext_trylock().

This is more ergonomic than scoped_guard() for most use cases.
Instead of hiding the error handling statement in the macro args, it
works like a normal if statement and allow the error path to be indented
while the normal code flow path is not indented. And it avoid unwanted
side-effect from hidden for loop in scoped_guard().
