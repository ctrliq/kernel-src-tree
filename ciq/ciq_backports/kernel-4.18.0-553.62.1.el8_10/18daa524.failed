Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-553.62.1.el8_10/18daa524.failed

If userspace reads "uevent" device attribute at the same time as another
threads unbinds the device from its driver, change to dev->driver from a
valid pointer to NULL may result in crash. Fix this by using READ_ONCE()
when fetching the pointer, and take bus' drivers klist lock to make sure
driver instance will not disappear while we access it.

Use WRITE_ONCE() when setting the driver pointer to ensure there is no
tearing.
