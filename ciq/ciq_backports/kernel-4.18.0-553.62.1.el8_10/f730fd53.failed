Guard functions in local_lock.h are defined using DEFINE_GUARD() and
DEFINE_LOCK_GUARD_1() macros having lock type defined as pointer in
the percpu address space. The functions, defined by these macros
return value in generic address space, causing:

cleanup.h:157:18: error: return from pointer to non-enclosed address space

and

cleanup.h:214:18: error: return from pointer to non-enclosed address space

when strict percpu checks are enabled.

Add explicit casts to remove address space of the returned pointer.

Found by GCC's named address space checks.
