Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-553.62.1.el8_10/c80c4490.failed

At some point during early development, the <linux/cleanup.h> header
must have been named <linux/guard.h>, as evidenced by the header
guard name:

  #ifndef __LINUX_GUARDS_H
  #define __LINUX_GUARDS_H

It ended up being <linux/cleanup.h>, but the old guard name for
a file name that was never upstream never changed.

Do that now - and while at it, also use the canonical _LINUX prefix,
instead of the less common __LINUX prefix.
