Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-553.62.1.el8_10/85be6d84.failed

recent discussion brought about the realization that it makes sense for
no_free_ptr() to have __must_check semantics in order to avoid leaking
the resource.

Additionally, add a few comments to clarify why/how things work.

All credit to Linus on how to combine __must_check and the
stmt-expression.
