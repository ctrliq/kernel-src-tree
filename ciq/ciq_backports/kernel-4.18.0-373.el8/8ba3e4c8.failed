mlx5e_close_xdpsq does the cleanup: it calls mlx5e_free_xdpsq_descs to
free the outstanding descriptors, which relies on
mlx5e_page_release_dynamic and page_pool_release_page. However,
page_pool_destroy is already called by this point, because
mlx5e_close_rq runs before mlx5e_close_xdpsq.

This commit fixes the use-after-free by swapping mlx5e_close_xdpsq and
mlx5e_close_rq.

The commit cited below started calling page_pool_destroy directly from
the driver. Previously, the page pool was destroyed under a call_rcu
from xdp_rxq_info_unreg_mem_model, which would defer the deallocation
until after the XDPSQ is cleaned up.
