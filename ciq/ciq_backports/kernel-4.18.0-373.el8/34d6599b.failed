Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-373.el8/34d6599b.failed

This patch converts the resource management in ISA es18xx driver with
devres as a clean up.  Each manual resource management is converted
with the corresponding devres helper.  The remove callback became
superfluous and dropped.

This should give no user-visible functional changes.
