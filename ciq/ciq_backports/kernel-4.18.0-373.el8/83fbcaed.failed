Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-373.el8/83fbcaed.failed

The recent refactoring of memalloc stuff removed the inclusion of
asm/page.h for simplicity, but it turned out this caused a compile
error due the lack of PAGE_SIZE definition on some architectures.
Do a partial revert for recovering from that.
