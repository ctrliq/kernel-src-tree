The unaligned DIO write path is more convolted than the normal path,
and we are about to make it more complex. Keep the block aligned
fast path dio write code trim and simple by splitting out the
unaligned DIO code from it.

++<<<<<<< HEAD
 + * xfs_file_dio_aio_write - handle direct IO writes
 + *
 + * Lock the inode appropriately to prepare for and issue a direct IO write.
 + * By separating it from the buffered write path we remove all the tricky to
 + * follow locking changes and looping.
 + *
 + * If there are cached pages or we're extending the file, we need IOLOCK_EXCL
 + * until we're sure the bytes at the new EOF have been zeroed and/or the cached
 + * pages are flushed out.
 + *
 + * In most cases the direct IO writes will be done holding IOLOCK_SHARED
 + * allowing them to be done in parallel with reads and other direct IO writes.
 + * However, if the IO is not aligned to filesystem blocks, the direct IO layer
 + * needs to do sub-block zeroing and that requires serialisation against other
 + * direct IOs to the same block. In this case we need to serialise the
 + * submission of the unaligned IOs so that we don't get racing block zeroing in
 + * the dio layer.  To avoid the problem with aio, we also need to wait for
 + * outstanding IOs to complete so that unwritten extent conversion is completed
 + * before we try to map the overlapping block. This is currently implemented by
 + * hitting it with a big hammer (i.e. inode_dio_wait()).
 + *
 + * Returns with locks held indicated by @iolock and errors indicated by
 + * negative return values.
