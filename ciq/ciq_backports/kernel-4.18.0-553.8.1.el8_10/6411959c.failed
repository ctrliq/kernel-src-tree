Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-553.8.1.el8_10/6411959c.failed

If the "struct can_priv::echoo_skb" is accessed out of bounds, this
would cause a kernel crash. Instead, issue a meaningful warning
message and return with an error.
