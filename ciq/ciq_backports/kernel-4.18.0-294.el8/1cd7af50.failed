 Two real time tasks pid=1234 running on processor 0 and pid=5678 running on
 processor 1 on socket 0 on a 2-socket and dual core machine. To avoid noisy
 neighbors, each of the two real-time tasks exclusively occupies one quarter
 of L3 cache on socket 0.

 Finally we move our first real time task into this resource group. We

 processors tasks run on.
