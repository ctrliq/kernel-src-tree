Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/70b44595.failed

The migration scanner is a linear scan of a zone with a potentiall large
search space.  Furthermore, many pageblocks are unusable such as those
filled with reserved pages or partially filled with pages that cannot
migrate.  These still get scanned in the common case of allocating a THP
and the cost accumulates.

The patch uses a partial search of the free lists to locate a migration
source candidate that is marked as MOVABLE when allocating a THP.  It
prefers picking a block with a larger number of free pages already on
the basis that there are fewer pages to migrate to free the entire
block.  The lowest PFN found during searches is tracked as the basis of
the start for the linear search after the first search of the free list
fails.  After the search, the free list is shuffled so that the next
search will not encounter the same page.  If the search fails then the
subsequent searches will be shorter and the linear scanner is used.

If this search fails, or if the request is for a small or
unmovable/reclaimable allocation then the linear scanner is still used.
It is somewhat pointless to use the list search in those cases.  Small
free pages must be used for the search and there is no guarantee that
movable pages are located within that block that are contiguous.

This shows an improvement in allocation latencies with similar
allocation success rates.  While not presented, there was a 31%
reduction in migration scanning and a 8% reduction on system CPU usage.
A 2-socket machine showed similar benefits.
