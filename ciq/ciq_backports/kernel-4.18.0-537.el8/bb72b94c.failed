Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-537.el8/bb72b94c.failed

Wrap note paragraphs in note:: directive as it better fit for the
purpose of noting devlink commands.

Fixes: f2d51e579359b7 ("net/mlx5: Separate mlx5 driver documentation into multiple pages")
Fixes: cf14af140a5ad0 ("net/mlx5e: Add vnic devlink health reporter to representors")
