Sphinx reports htmldocs warnings:

Documentation/networking/device_drivers/ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/devlink.rst:287: WARNING: Unexpected indentation.
Documentation/networking/device_drivers/ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/devlink.rst:288: WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
Documentation/networking/device_drivers/ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/devlink.rst:290: WARNING: Unexpected indentation.

Fix above warnings by wrapping diagnostic devlink commands in "vnic
reporter" section in code blocks to be consistent with other devlink
command snippets.
