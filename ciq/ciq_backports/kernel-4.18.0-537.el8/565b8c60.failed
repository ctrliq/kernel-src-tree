commit 565b8c60e90f7f2d4763f5979c7aaa43697ab950
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-537.el8/565b8c60.failed

"vnic reporter" section contains unformatted description for vnic
counters, which is rendered as one long paragraph instead of list.

Use bullet and definition lists to match other lists.
