commit 8a32d0fee43d9f4bcaacb3234301a8f1fea8925b
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-537.el8/8a32d0fe.failed

These two places are rendered like a table in the source (rst) code,
but they are seen as plain text by formatters, and thus are joined
together into a single line, e.g.:

> “root” - a partition root “member” - a non-root member of a partition

This is definitely not what was intended.

To fix, use table formatting, like in other places.
