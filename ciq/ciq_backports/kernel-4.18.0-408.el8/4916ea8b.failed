Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-408.el8/4916ea8b.failed

KVM_CAP_VM_MOVE_ENC_CONTEXT_FROM leaves the source VM in a dead state,
so migrating back to the original source VM fails the ioctl.  Adjust
the test.
