Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

This makes the output of smcr_link_down tracepoint easier to use and
understand without additional translating function's pointer address.

It prints the function name with offset:

  <idle>-0       [000] ..s.    69.087164: smcr_link_down: lnk=00000000dab41cdc lgr=000000007d5d8e24 state=0 rc=1 dev=mlx5_0 location=smc_wr_tx_tasklet_fn+0x5ef/0x6f0 [smc]
