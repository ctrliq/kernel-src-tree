Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-408.el8/d61f4274.failed

This element has a very dynamic structure, create a small helper
function to validate its size. We're currently checking it in
mac80211 in a conversion function, but that's actually slightly
buggy.
