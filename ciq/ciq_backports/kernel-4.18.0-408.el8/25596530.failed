This patch reduces the running time for hmm-tests from about 10+ seconds,
to just under 1.0 second, for an approximately 10x speedup.  That brings
it in line with most of the other tests in selftests/vm, which mostly run
in < 1 sec.

This is done with a one-line change that simply reduces the number of
iterations of several tests, from 256, to 10.  Thanks to Ralph Campbell
for suggesting changing NTIMES as a way to get the speedup.
