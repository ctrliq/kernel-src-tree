THERMAL_NETLINK depends on NET and since 'select' does not follow
any dependency chain, INTEL_HFI_THERMAL also should depend on NET.

Fix one Kconfig warning and 48 subsequent build errors:

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for THERMAL_NETLINK
  Depends on [n]: THERMAL [=y] && NET [=n]
  Selected by [y]:
  - INTEL_HFI_THERMAL [=y] && THERMAL [=y] && (X86 [=y] || X86_INTEL_QUARK [=n] || COMPILE_TEST [=y]) && CPU_SUP_INTEL [=y] && X86_THERMAL_VECTOR [=y]
