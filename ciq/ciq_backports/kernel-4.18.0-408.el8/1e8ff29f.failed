Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

I managed to get hold of a machine that has SEV but not SEV-ES, and
sev_migrate_tests fails because sev_vm_create(true) returns ENOTTY.
Fix this, and while at it also return KSFT_SKIP on machines that do
not have SEV at all, instead of returning 0.
