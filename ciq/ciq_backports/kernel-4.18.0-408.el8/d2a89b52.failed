The initcalls like to play joke. In our case, the thermal-netlink
initcall is called after the thermal-core initcall but this one sends
a notification before the former is initialized. No issue was spotted,
but it could lead to a memory corruption, so instead of relying on the
core_initcall for the thermal-netlink, let's initialize directly from
the thermal-core init routine, so we have full control of the init
ordering.
