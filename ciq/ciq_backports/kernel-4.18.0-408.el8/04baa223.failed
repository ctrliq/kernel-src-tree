Add a helper function that creates a pmu event filter given an event
list.  Currently, a pmu event filter can only be created with the same
hard coded event list.  Add a way to create one given a different event
list.

Also, rename make_pmu_event_filter to alloc_pmu_event_filter to clarify
it's purpose given the introduction of create_pmu_event_filter.

No functional changes intended.
