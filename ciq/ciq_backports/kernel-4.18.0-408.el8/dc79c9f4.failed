Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-408.el8/dc79c9f4.failed

I am putting the tests in sev_migrate_tests because the failure conditions are
very similar and some of the setup code can be reused, too.

The tests cover both successful creation of a mirror VM, and error
conditions.
