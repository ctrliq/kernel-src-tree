Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-408.el8/79593c08.failed

If the cache's user host virtual address becomes invalid, there
is still a path from kvm_gfn_to_pfn_cache_refresh() where __release_gpc()
could release the pfn but the gpc->pfn field has not been overwritten
with an error value.  If this happens, kvm_gfn_to_pfn_cache_unmap will
call put_page again on the same page.
