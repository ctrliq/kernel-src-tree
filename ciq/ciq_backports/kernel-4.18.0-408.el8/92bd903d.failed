commit 92bd903da12b0c0c5e9e2f560388fe80bb7ce749
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-408.el8/92bd903d.failed

Code inspection has found an additional reference is taken in
lpfc_bsg_rport_els(). Results in the ndlp not being freed thus is leaked.

Fix by removing the redundant refcount taken before WQE submission.
