Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-477.27.1.el8_8/75e406b5.failed

Currently when the uncore_write() returns error, it is silently
ignored. Return error to user space when uncore_write() fails.
