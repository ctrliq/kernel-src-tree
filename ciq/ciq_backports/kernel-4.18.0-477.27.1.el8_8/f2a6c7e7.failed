Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Currently the uncore_freq_common_init() return one on success and
zero on failure.  There is only one caller and it has a "forgot to set
the error code" bug.  Change uncore_freq_common_init() to return
negative error codes which makes the code simpler and avoids this kind
of bug in the future.
