Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-5.14.0-570.46.1.el9_6/8ccc5947.failed

The oxid variable in fdls_process_abts_req() was only being initialized
inside the if (tport) block, but was being used in a debug print statement
after that block. If tport was NULL, oxid would remain uninitialized.  Move
the oxid initialization to happen at declaration using
FNIC_STD_GET_OX_ID(fchdr).
