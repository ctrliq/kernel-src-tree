Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-553.22.1.el8_10/59f60005.failed

This consistency check was originally added by commit 9287c6452d2b1
("gfs2: Fix occasional glock use-after-free").  It is ill-placed in
gfs2_glock_free() because if it holds there, it must equally hold in
__gfs2_glock_put() already.  Either way, the check doesn't seem
necessary anymore.
