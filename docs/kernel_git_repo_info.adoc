== Kernel Git Repository Information

There are many source-git and dist-git repositories that are used to construct Red Hat kernels.  Some of these repositories are used for testing (CKI), but most of these repositories are used for code that is shipped to customers.   Red Hat kernel git repositories use ‘main’ in place of git’s default ‘master’ branch.

=== source-git repositories

Public git repositories can be used by both Red Hat and non-Red Hat contributors.  Private git repositories are restricted to Red Hat contributors and Partner contributors.

The general model of these repositories is that the main branch tracks the current minor development, and other branches track old minor development (commonly referred to as ‘z-stream’).  Some repositories may also contain Real Time kernel branches that are tagged with “-rt”.

For example, the rhel-8 repository contains branches and the main branch (as of writing this section) is for 8.5 development

  remotes/origin/8.0 +
  remotes/origin/8.1 +
  remotes/origin/8.2 +
  remotes/origin/8.2-rt +
  remotes/origin/8.3 +
  remotes/origin/8.3-rt +
  remotes/origin/8.4 +
  remotes/origin/8.4-rt +
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/main +
  remotes/origin/main +
  remotes/origin/main-rt

=== CI git trees

TBD

The kernel workflow relies heavily on CI automation which is implemented in various repositories.  <TBD: put in a link to CKI here?  Or maybe the CKI section below?>
