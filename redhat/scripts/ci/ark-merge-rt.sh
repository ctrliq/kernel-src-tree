# This script is intended to sync up the RT and automotive branch (derivative
# of RT).  It adds the extra twist of detecting the right upstream rt branch
# to sync with depending on the existance of the next branch.  Sometimes the
# rt-devel branch waits until -rc1/2 to create new branches.
# Finally the code handles the rebases in those cases where newer branches
# are available.
#
# Why the complexity?
# Development branches will need to be periodically rebased unfortunately.
# Using 'git rebase --onto <new head> <old_head>' only works with one common
# branch to rebase from not two.  Meanwhile, the -devel branches are formed
# from two upstream branches, os-build and linux-rt-devel.  The idea is
# to merge the two branches into a single throwaway branch that can be
# recreated from scratch anytime then use that as the base for -devel.
