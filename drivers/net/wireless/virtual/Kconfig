	  This driver is a developer testing tool that can be used to test
	  IEEE 802.11 networking stack (mac80211) functionality. This is not

	  Documentation/networking/mac80211_hwsim for more information on how
	  to use this tool.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called mac80211_hwsim.  If unsure, say N.
