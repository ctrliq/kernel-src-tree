config RHEL_DIFFERENCES
	bool "Enable RHEL-only code"
	help
	  This option controls whether rhel-only changes are enabled during
	  the build. Unless you want to enable rhel-only changes, say N here.

config RH_KABI_SIZE_ALIGN_CHECKS
	bool "Enables more stringent kabi checks in the macros"
	depends on RHEL_DIFFERENCES
	default y
	help
	  This option enables more stringent kabi checks. Those must
	  be disabled in case of a debug build, because debug builds
	  allow to change struct sizes.

config RH_AUTOMOTIVE
	bool "Enable automotive only code"
	depends on RHEL_DIFFERENCES
	default n
	help
	  This option controls whether code is included in the automotive
	  kernel build. If you are building an automotive kernel, say Y.
